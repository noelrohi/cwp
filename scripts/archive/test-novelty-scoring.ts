    content: `Yeah. Kind of bring them up to speed. And this is the context. I also think there's an additional benefit it to make it public facing because humans buy stories. Money flows as a function of stories. And I've experienced this. It's like if I read, I spend forty hours reading about this person that had this idea in their head, they built a company, at the end of that, you're going to have a way better appreciation. I would find out buying their products that I never even would have thought of because now I understand the story. I just reread James Tyson's autobiography, which is one of my favorite books, probably my number one recommendation out of the 400 books I've read so far, just because it's like 90% struggle. The first autobiography is just like, I'm failing for fourteen years. This guy is like a mule. He won't give up. 5,127 prototypes. But there's an idea in the book that was smart where he understood the power of storytelling. Okay? And so he's like, you're going to walk into the retailer, you're going to see six different vacuum cleaners. His obviously is designed different, so it's going to catch your eye. But he insisted they wrote like a 200 word story on like a little flyer, right? Maybe like a little piece of cardboard and that you could attach it to the handle of the vacuum cleaner. And what happens if that person, humans are attracted to stories, they're attracted to people, right? And so they would, they read that and then they, it would increase their sales because they understood who's behind this. Why did they make it? How is it different? Like, was a very effective sales tool. So I think like doing podcasts like this, books, anything like this, where you can actually tell like why you're doing what you're doing. This is the crazy thing. I've heard from, I don't know, I've probably got thousands of messages about the episode I did on you. And the most common thing was I knew the name. I had no idea.`,

    content: `That's what you do. That's exactly. I think that's the biggest thing, man. It's like, it's an unfair advantage if you can direct your energy at something that you there's no we talked about this at dinner. We have a mutual friend and Sam Hincky. And one of the things that's interesting about Sam is if you analyze who he keeps around him, they're they're they're they have different interests. You know? It's like this podcaster dude, this investor guy, this entrepreneur Mhmm. This, like, athlete. And he's like, what what what I'm drawn to, what all these people have in common that may not be obvious to you, David, is that there's no end to like, can't get to the end of what they're interested in. You think you use the analogy of like a cup. You just pour and pour and pour. It's just like it just keeps going. Like, they can never get to the end of their curiosity. And I think you're a perfect example of that, where if you look at other founders that are doing things for fame or status or whatever the case is, it's like Jerry Seinfeld has a great line. He goes, If you just do it for the money, you're only going to go so far.`,

    content: `love about this, and this is why it's so important because and I mentioned this on the episode. I made it on you. But there's this this engineer turned founder, Sidney Harman. You know the company Harman Kardon? Yeah, sure. Yeah. So he has a great line. He said that the founder is the guardian of the company's soul, that it's impossible to separate, you know, the creation from the creator. And I think over time, like the I resemble that. Goddamn right you do. This is also, again, how abnormal we are. Used I to say it's like you need to build a business that's authentic to you. And then in this book, Lee was, you know, talking about he was only able to last four years, think.`,

    content: `is why I think entrepreneurs have to, like, study past entrepreneurs too, it's, like, obviously very valuable. Like, it's it's no surprise that, like, you were reading about these people. Like, what I would say is, like, the greats all studied the greats. This is, very it's, like, they were doing it today. They were doing it forty years ago. They were doing it two hundred years ago. If you took, like, an average person in normal society and the way they think about experts, okay, and the way it's discussed in all these biographies, it's like they're very dismissive of experts. Right? I just mentioned I was reading James Dyson's autobiography. You know, the whole thing is just like he believes in the Edisonian principle of design, just constant iteration. You learn as you go. You can't predict. Like, you just, you know, change one thing and then test it and see how it goes. And he mentions setting Henry Ford a lot in that book. And then James Dyson wrote an autobiography thirty years after that, that he also mentions Henry Ford a lot. And the reason I thought of that is because as you were speaking about, you know, you go and ask an expert from ten years ago, what's going to happen? Like, they're not going to tell you that ChatGPT is, know, that my 13 year old, I use ChatGPT all the time, but I'm a nerd. I like to research stuff. I like to read about stuff. She uses like a therapist, a shopper, a friend. It's an entire ecosystem. There's no way you can predict that. There's a great line in Henry Ford's autobiography, which was written January ago. This is not a new phenomenon. Human nature does not change. History doesn't repeat. Human nature does. And he says, If I ever want to sabotage my competition, I would fill their ranks with experts. Experts tend to know so much, and they're so convinced that they're right, they'd get no work done.`,
