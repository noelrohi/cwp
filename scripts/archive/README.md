# Archived Scripts

These scripts are kept for historical reference but are no longer actively used.

## Obsolete Model Testing
- `test-kimi-30-signals.ts` - Kimi-k2 variance testing (replaced by Grok-4-fast)
- `test-hybrid-scoring.ts` - Old hybrid scoring tests
- `test-novelty-scoring.ts` - Duplicate of test-novelty-enabled.ts

## One-off Debugging Tools
- `debug-heuristic-single.ts` - Single signal heuristic debugging
- `test-single-signal.ts` - Generic single signal testing
- `test-specific-signal.ts` - Generic specific signal testing
- `find-and-test-signal.ts` - One-off signal finder

## Why Archived

These scripts were used during development and testing but are no longer needed:
- Model testing scripts are obsolete after switching from Kimi-k2 to Grok-4-fast
- One-off debugging scripts were for specific issues that are now resolved
- Functionality has been consolidated into current test scripts

## Current Active Scripts

See `/scripts/` directory for currently maintained scripts.
