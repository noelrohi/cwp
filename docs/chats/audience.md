Perfect — narrowing your first audience solves two problems at once:

Cold start (you don’t need “all podcasts,” just the ones relevant to consulting/leadership/founders).

Onboarding clarity (you can personalize the experience immediately).

Here’s how to frame it:

🎯 Audience: C-level consulting leaders & founders

Their jobs = scanning for insights on strategy, AI, organizational design, transformation, markets.

Their pain = no time to wade through hours of podcasts.

Your edge = ontology + discovery layer → surface reusable patterns (not just snippets).

🔑 Onboarding flow for this segment

Pick your themes (1 min)

Prompt: “Which themes are you most interested in learning from podcasts?”

Options (multi-select): AI, leadership, consulting industry shifts, org design, entrepreneurship, markets.

Behind the scenes: map these to ex:Topic in your ontology.

Show curated episode library

Only podcasts tagged with those themes.

Each episode card shows: title, guest, company, key takeaways, 2–3 suggested questions.

Highlight global Q&A

At the top: “Ask across all strategy podcasts…”

Example queries:

“What do founders say about early growth loops?”

“How are consulting leaders using AI with clients?”

Behind the scenes: semantic search across episodes tagged with chosen topics.

Deliver early win

First screen = “3 insights you might like” generated from their topic choices.

Each insight links back to a specific episode + timestamp → instant credibility.

📈 Benefits of focusing on this segment

Sharper ontology: You don’t need every schema property yet. Just double down on Person (guest), Topic, Quote, and Company.

Better starter prompts: Since founders/consultants ask predictable types of questions (frameworks, case studies, predictions), you can preload them.

Distribution leverage: You can drive initial users straight from your newsletter → early retention cohort.

⚙️ Implementation guide for dev

During onboarding: store topic preferences in user profile.

Query pipeline: restrict search/ranking to episodes with matching topics.

UI:

Episode cards (title, guest, company, 3 takeaways).

Global Q&A bar with pre-suggested prompts.

“Show me episodes about AI in consulting” button → filters applied automatically.

👉 The mental model: Don’t sell “all podcasts.” Sell a consulting knowledge assistant powered by podcasts.

Do you want me to draft a concrete onboarding script + UI copy for your consulting-leader persona? Something you can drop straight into onboarding screens?
