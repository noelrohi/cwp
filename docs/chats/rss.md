Pretty much, yes—with a few gotchas. Here’s the practical way to do it fast and safely.

How it works

Grab audio from RSS

Most podcast RSS feeds include an <enclosure> with the audio URL (usually MP3; sometimes AAC/M4A).

On ingest, store: audio_url, mime_type, length_bytes.

Do a quick HEAD to verify:

Accept-Ranges: bytes (you need this for seeking)

Content-Type is audio/* (mp3/m4a)

CORS headers (if you’ll play from your domain)

Play from the right spot (client)

Use a plain <audio> element.

After loadedmetadata, set audio.currentTime = start_sec, then audio.play().

To stop at end_sec, set a timer or listen to timeupdate and pause() when currentTime >= end_sec.

Mobile note: you’ll need a user gesture (tap) before you can start playback.

When it just works

Many hosts/CDNs (Libsyn, Megaphone, Buzzsprout, Spotify for Podcasters) support byte range requests and CORS → seeking is fine.

When it doesn’t

No CORS: browser blocks it. Fallbacks:

Offer an “Open in …” deep link (Apple Podcasts / Spotify / YouTube) at the timestamp if supported.

Or proxy the audio through your server (adds cost + legal considerations; use carefully).

No Accept-Ranges: some legacy hosts won’t seek. Fallback to normal play (no jump) or open-in-app.

Legal/etiquette

Don’t re-host or re-encode without permission.

Stream from the publisher’s URL, show source + link prominently.

Keep snippets short by default (e.g., 30–90s) and user-initiated.

Minimal implementation checklist

RSS ingest: parse <enclosure>, store audio_url, mime, bytes.

Health check job:

HEAD each audio_url → record accept_ranges, cors_ok boolean.

UI:

Show text citation first (fast TTV).

If cors_ok && accept_ranges, show ▶️ button to play [start_sec, end_sec].

Else show Open in links (Spotify supports ?t=SECONDS; YouTube ?t=; Apple varies—fallback to episode page).

Player logic (pseudo):

const audio = new Audio(src);
audio.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', () => {
  audio.currentTime = startSec;
  audio.play();
});
const onUpdate = () => {
  if (audio.currentTime >= endSec) audio.pause();
};
audio.addEventListener('timeupdate', onUpdate);


Accessibility: keyboard controls, visible transcript, and a big pause button.

Analytics: log “started clip”, “completed clip”, “opened external”.

Nice-to-haves (later)

Karaoke highlight: scroll the transcript and highlight words while playing (use your timestamps).

Deep links: yourapp.com/ep/:id?t=2050 → auto-seek player.

Download guard: set controlsList="nodownload" (not bulletproof, but courteous).

Server-side proxy toggle for hosts with bad CORS (use sparingly, consider caching headers and terms).

Bottom line

Text citations first (instant value).

Play audio spans when the host allows it (simple <audio> + seek).

Fallback to “open in app” when CORS/range is blocked.

That gives you a slick, credible experience without building heavy media infrastructure or taking on hosting risk.
