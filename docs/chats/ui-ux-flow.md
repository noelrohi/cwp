Perfect — here’s a lean UI/UX flow for onboarding and usage if you launch text-first, with a clear path to add audio later.

🖥️ User Flow (Text-first)
1. Onboarding

User picks topics (e.g. AI, Entrepreneurship).

Show them a curated set of episodes cards (title, guest, date, 2–3 key takeaways).

At the top: “Ask a question across all episodes” search bar.

2. Asking a Question

User types: “What mistakes do first-time AI founders make?”

System retrieves transcript chunks.

Answer screen shows:

LLM summary answer (2–4 sentences).

Citations as collapsible text snippets:

Dwarkesh: "... most founders underinvest in distribution early..."
[ep_dwarkesh_ai_2025 @ 18:05–18:45]
Acquired: "... capital misallocation was the #1 killer of SaaS AI plays..."
[ep_acquired_ai_2025 @ 42:12–43:00]


Feedback row: Helpful 👍 | Not Helpful 👎 | Better Clip?

3. Saving & Collections

Each snippet has a Save button → adds it to My Playbook.

My Playbook = a list of saved text spans, grouped by topic (AI, Entrepreneurship).

🎧 Phase 2: Audio Layer (drop-in upgrade)

Episode table already stores audio_url.

Each citation snippet gets a ▶️ Play button.

When clicked → lightweight audio player seeks to start_sec.

Transcript highlight scrolls with audio (karaoke-style optional).

📊 Why text-first works

Exec persona fit: They often skim for insights → text snippets are enough for onboarding value.

Trust & citations: Text spans with timestamps prove you’re grounded in the source, not hallucinating.

Infra-light: Just a text viewer + Postgres lookups.

Upgrade path: Adding audio doesn’t require changing retrieval/citations — only the rendering layer.

✅ Developer Checklist

Render answer + 2–3 citations as text.

Each citation = [snippet text + episode + timestamp].

Save button = writes (user_id, citation_id) into a table.

Build My Playbook screen = saved citations grouped by topic.

Add audio_url field now (even if you don’t render it yet).

👉 This way you can ship in weeks, look credible with text-only, and flip on audio later with minimal rework.

Do you want me to also sketch what the “My Playbook” screen should look like for a founder/consulting leader persona? That’s usually where ongoing retention kicks in.
