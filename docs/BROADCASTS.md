#  From Observer to Participant 

 The exploration phase is over. The NewCo building phase begins 

 Usman Sheikh 

 October 9th, 2025 ​ 

 I stopped writing three weeks ago. Not because I ran out of ideas, but because I needed to narrow my focus. 

 For ten months, I wrote daily about professional services disruption, the future of work, and how we'd be impacted. [ Writing daily forces a kind of obsession ] , each post another rep, another chance to see patterns others miss in the daily deluge. 

 But that breadth was preventing me from going deep on the massive opportunity I was writing about: [ the disruption of the $13 trillion labor market, where software is moving from digitizing filing cabinets to delivering actual outcomes. ] ​ 

 ** The writing was never about becoming a writer, it was a forcing function to accelerate learning. ** Each post revealed another piece of the transformation, but the writing itself had become the trap. 

 I was stuck in observation mode, the very momentum that revealed the opportunity now preventing me from acting on it. 

 Stopping was difficult. I had a comfortable rhythm and strong engagement. But I felt continuing meant remaining an observer when this moment demanded participation. 

 ** When I asked all of you in my last email what resonated most in my months of writing, your answer was unanimous: go deeper on NewCo opportunity. ** 

 Not simply the theory but specific mechanics. 

 How do you price outcomes instead of hours? What team structure works? What's the tech stack, the GTM? These aren't academic questions anymore. The firms on the edges are all rapidly experimenting with these new engagement models. 

 We're in a transition with no playbooks. LegacyCo's reorganize quarterly, while the NewCo opportunity becomes clearer every day. 

 ** This is where I'm focusing now, not observing the disruption, but funding and building the firms in this space. ** 

 The daily sprint is over. The newsletter will now be focused on NewCo, diving deep into what's actually working with companies I'm investing in and advising. These posts will be sent only to newsletter subscribers. 

 I will be using LinkedIn for quick reactions to market moves, the occasional longer piece when something needs saying. 

 Why the shift? I've mapped the terrain. Now it's time to build on it. 

 I've started working closely with portfolio companies pivoting into the NewCo space and advising a scaled consulting firm launching a NewCo division. 

 Every week I'll break down how to build firms that capture this shift. 

 ** Thank you to the thousands of readers who've shaped this exploration. Your critiques, insights, and challenges refined these ideas far beyond what any solo effort could achieve. ** 

 This was never a monologue, it was a community mapping the future together. For all the subscribers, we're building a dedicated space to continue these conversations. Connecting builders, sharing wins and failures, pressure-testing ideas before they hit the market. 

 I will be dropping more details on this in the coming weeks ahead. 

 If you're building a NewCo, I want to hear from you. What problems are you solving? What friction points are you hitting? How can I help? The best insights have come from these direct conversations. 

 The next quarter will be about refining the NewCo thesis with real data from real builders. Bigger announcement coming Q1 2026. 

 ** The old frames are cracking everywhere. Time to build new ones. **

#  Frame Break 
#  When Obsession Finds Its Tribe 

 Frame Break enters its next phase 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 13th, 2025 ​ 

 The moment you develop the capacity to see what's missing, you can't unsee it. 

 This isn't about choosing high standards or [ developing taste through discipline ] . It's about being consumed by a vision that colors every encounter with what is. 

 ** Joseph Campbell wrote about the hero's calling, but he underplayed the involuntary nature of it. ** 

 You don't accept the call so much as discover you've already answered it. The obsession has already taken root before you recognize its presence, and you don't cultivate this sight; it claims you. 

 Once claimed, you carry its weight everywhere you go. 

 ** This possession manifests as standards you never asked for, ** [ ** seeing voids others don't even know exist ** ] ** . ** 

 Most mistake this for perfectionism or high achievement, but it's neither. Perfectionism wants control while achievement seeks recognition. Excellence wants truth - the closing of the gap between what is and what could be. 

 It's the difference between polishing something until it looks good or being tormented by the gap between its current form and its potential. 

 ** This burden reveals itself slowly. ** 

 At first, you think everyone sees what you see. Then you realize they genuinely don't perceive the missing pieces and lost opportunities that scream at you. 

 It happens gradually, in conversations where you realize the team isn't making excuses; they believe adequate performance is good enough. 

 ** This realization is both liberating and isolating. ** 

 Liberating because you stop expecting others to care about what you care about. Isolating because excellence becomes a solitary pursuit when surrounded by people who've made peace with mediocrity you can't unsee. 

 ** When your taste develops ** [ ** beyond your environment's resolution ** ] ** , you exist between scenes. ** 

 Too demanding for those who accept good enough, too unproven for those who've achieved mastery. 

 Most people sense this selection happening and turn away, choosing blindness because seeing demands they become responsible for what they perceive. 

 But some can't turn away. 

 Something in them responds to the call, even knowing it means carrying the weight forever. They become unwilling prophets of possibility. 

 ** The state transforms when you find others who see at your resolution. ** 

 A room where your obsession becomes shared language, where the standards that isolate you elsewhere become the price of admission. 

 ​ [ The tribe doesn't eliminate the weight of seeing ] ; it makes the weight meaningful. You stop carrying it alone. 

 ** I feel this burden acutely now, writing about excellence while carrying that same weight with these posts. ** 

 The daily cadence that served discovery doesn't serve the process of going deeper. 

 What started as surface observations about AI tools and professional services has pulled me deeper into understanding the seismic shift we are living through. The NewCo framework has the scaffolding and over the next few months I will be refining it further. 

 ** Starting Monday, I'm taking a two-week break from publishing. ** 

 When I return, the work will follow a new rhythm - some pieces emerging quickly, others developing over weeks. 

 The conversations these pieces have sparked tell me something important: we're not just sharing ideas anymore, we're building something together. A tribe of people who see the same voids, feel the same weight, and refuse to look away. 

 ** The next phase of Frame Break isn't just deeper writing. It is about what emerges when obsession finds its tribe. ** 

 P.S. Please reply this email and let me know: Which pieces have resonated most? And what would you want from a Frame Break community?

#  Building by Removing 

 What remains when the frameworks disappear 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 14th, 2025 ​ 

 We build rails for everything measurable. 

 Data, compliance, workflow, metrics. 

 But judgment? No rails exist because judgment isn't built. It's earned through reps and consequences. Through being wrong enough times that you finally see clearly. 

 Early on, I took every successful person's advice as gospel. We don't trust ourselves, so we use others as crutches. 

 Most of that advice hurt me in hindsight. But that's how you learn. 

 Consequence is the only teacher. Ship the project that can fail. Publish the draft that gets torn apart. Reality teaches what advisors can't. 

 The key is to find work where feedback is immediate. Where results can't hide. Do fewer things but get more reps. Each critique and failed attempt compounds into judgment no framework could give you. 

 If every tool, framework, advisor, and method vanished tomorrow, would you still know what to do? 

 If not, you're leaning on scaffolding, not standing on legs. 

 Most infrastructure adds. Judgment infrastructure subtracts - it strips away until only clarity remains. 

 ** Reflection for the week: ** What will you remove this week to see clearly?

#  Yes, It's a Bubble. That's the Point. 

 $600 Billion Says Build Now, Ask Questions Later 

 Usman Sheikh 

 Septemeber 12th, 2025 ​ 

 Mark Zuckerberg recently told the president [ Meta plans to invest at least $600B on AI infrastructure by 2028 ] . 

 That number approaches Sweden's entire GDP. Bigger than the market cap of all but a handful of companies listed today. 

 Posts about imminent crash and waste surged after the announcement. 

 They're right about the arithmetic, but they're wrong about what just happened. 

 Zuckerberg didn't announce a budget. He fired the starting gun on solving a ** coordination problem: who builds shared infrastructure that only becomes economically viable once everyone uses it? ** 

 The entire supply chain from chip design to fab-tool makers and foundries to the data centers which will house them and the cloud infrastructure providers wondering: ** "should we triple production?" got their answer. ** 

 ​ [ The White House dinner ] provided political blessing for one of the largest private infrastructure buildouts in U.S. history. 

 Three years of demand, announced in a single sentence. 

 We're living through a bubble. 

 The discomfort you feel reading that sentence? Every generation inside one feels the same way. Nobody wants to believe they're caught up in collective mania. But here we are. 

 ** Companies will be disrupted, fortunes will evaporate and in this cycle we may ** [ ** unbundle the corporate job ** ] ** . ** 

 This pattern isn't a glitch but the mechanism of progress itself. 

 We dress it up as "creative destruction" to make it sound strategic. It's not. It's messy and painful and absolutely necessary. 

 ​ [ Carlota Perez's book * Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital * ] maps this pattern across 250 years of technology revolutions. The same story plays out every time. 

 First comes the spark of innovation, then the frenzy where financial capital misprices risk and overfunds installation. After the crash comes the turning point, then synergy, then a golden age built on the infrastructure the madness left behind. 

 ** Perez's key insight was bubbles solve a coordination problem capitalism can't solve any other way. ** 
###  ** How Bubbles Build Tomorrow ** 

 No rational actor builds shared infrastructure alone. If you dig the canal, competitors use it. If you lay the fiber, rivals ride it. 

 The smart move is to wait for someone else to go first. So everyone waits, and nothing gets built. 

 Bubbles break this paralysis through collective irrationality. 

 When everyone believes prices only go up, everyone builds at once. Not because it makes sense, but because the bubble creates a shared delusion that demand is infinite. 

 ** History keeps showing us the same pattern: ** 

 ** Dot-com bubble (1990s): ** Telecoms buried massive fiber capacity. By late 2002, only a tiny fraction of fibers carried any traffic. The companies died. The fiber remained. Today that "waste" carries Netflix, Zoom, cloud computing and most of modern life itself. 

 ** Railway mania (1840s): ** Promoters laid track to nowhere, sold shares to everyone. The crash of 1847 destroyed fortunes but left Britain with a dense national rail + telegraph backbone. 

 ** Canal mania (1790s): ** Speculators dug waterways with "different widths and depths and much inefficient routing." Messy, chaotic, economically insane. Britain got the transport grid that powered the first industrial revolution. 

 The pattern never varies: massive overbuild, spectacular crash, but the infrastructure remains and a golden age begins. 
###  ** What Makes This Time Different And The Same ** 

 Unlike canals or railways that rolled out regionally, AI hits everyone, everywhere, all at once. The call center rep and the banker, the developer and the consultant. All disrupted simultaneously. 

 Unlike previous infrastructure that complemented human work, this might be the first that substitutes a larger share of cognitive tasks than prior waves. 

 But the mechanism stays identical. 

 ** What looks like waste today: ** GPU clusters running at low utilization as workloads ramp. Redundant data centers in every region. Power infrastructure built for 10x current load. Competing evaluation frameworks that will mostly die. 

 ** What it becomes tomorrow: ** Ambient intelligence as utility. Compute at one tenth today's cost. The cognitive infrastructure for whatever comes next. 

 The waste is the point. 
 The redundancy is the feature. 
 The overbuild is the gift to the future. 
###  ** The Harvest After the Pop ** 

 The bubble will pop, as they always do when the gap between paper wealth and the real economy becomes unsustainable. Meta might not spend the full $600 billion, but that's not the point. 

 The announcement already did its job. The coordination problem is solved. The rails are being laid. 

 Unlike railroads, these GPUs will be obsolete in a few years. But the patterns we discover, the expertise we build, and the workflows we validate - those will persist. 

 When this crashes, we inherit intelligence infrastructure at a scale no rational planning process would have approved. The next generation will treat AI like we treat bandwidth today - abundant and cheap. 

 This changes how work happens, not through task augmentation but through system transformation. [ When cognitive work approaches negligible marginal cost ] , the entire economy reorganizes. 

 The winners won't be those who time the top. They'll be those building for the post-crash world, when intelligence becomes a utility and the real work begins. 

 We have always come out stronger on the other side. That's not optimism. That's pattern recognition. 

 Yes, you're living through a bubble. 
 Yes, there will be casualties. 

 The [ two timelines of destruction and creation ] are both real, happening simultaneously. 

 So while everyone's debating whether this is 1999 or 1849, the real builders are asking a different question: 

 ** What becomes possible when intelligence costs approach zero? ** 

 The infrastructure is getting built either way. The only question is whether you're building for the world that's coming or clinging to the world that's ending. 

 The rails always outlast the bubble. Build accordingly.

## Case Study #21: Trust Relocation

#  Frame Break 
#  Case Study #21: Trust Relocation 

 GitLab's $8B playbook: from promises to proof 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 11th, 2025 ​ 

 San Francisco, 2013. 

 ​ [ Sid Sijbrandij paid for office space after Y Combinator insisted remote wouldn't scale. ] His employees came for three days. 

 Then stopped showing up. 
 They were shipping faster from home. 

 Since 2012, GitLab had been forced to write everything down. With employees distributed across Europe and the US, every decision required written reasoning that others could follow. 

 ** This constraint would accidentally solve enterprise software's biggest problem: how to trust a startup with your data. ** 

 Today GitLab is a public company worth $8B. Not because they built better DevOps tools. Because they built a software company that runs like software itself, inspectable and auditable. 

 They didn't eliminate the need for trust. 

 They relocated it from salespeople to source code. 
###  ** The Trust Tax in Enterprise Software ** 

 Enterprises evaluating software ask one question: Can we risk our business on this? Traditional vendors have spent decades perfecting their answer. It looks like this: 

 ** The 18-Month Trust Dance: ** 
 → Discovery calls and executive briefings 
 → Reference calls with other CIOs 
 → Proof-of-concepts and pilot programs 
 → Security reviews and compliance audits 
 → Vendor promises wrapped in PowerPoints 

 Every step is designed to build confidence through relationships. 

 Wine the executives at expensive dinners, have surprise guests like the CEO drop in. Deploy armies of solutions engineers. 

 ** All for one thing: the signature through persuasion. ** 

 This process costs millions and takes forever. Enterprises accept it because what is the alternative? You can't easily trust a vendor's word that their software is secure and compliant. 

 GitLab looked at this entire dance and asked a different question: 

 What if customers could verify everything themselves? 
###  ** GitLab's Radical Relocation ** 

 Their [ open-core model ] meant customers could inspect the community edition and run it on their own servers. 

 If GitLab disappeared tomorrow, the software would keep running. 

 They went further by publishing their [ 2,000+ page operating handbook ] . Not marketing material, but their actual playbooks for decision-making and governance. 

 Any enterprise could verify exactly how GitLab worked. 

 ** But the real innovation wasn't transparency itself. It was structuring everything around one atomic unit: the merge request. ** 

 The MR became their [ trust architecture ] . Every change flowed through this single point. Not because they planned it that way. 

 Because working remotely work demanded it. 
###  The Architecture That Forces Trust 

 The merge request isn't simply version control. It's where code gets better through automated tests, peer reviews, and continuous integration. But crucially, it's also governance made visible. 

 Developers didn't adopt GitLab for compliance. They adopted it because it made shipping code easier. 

 ** The audit trail was a byproduct that became the product. ** 

 ​ [ CACI, a government contractor ] , consolidated seven different DevOps tools into GitLab and cut their administrative overhead by 90%. 

 Compliance audits that took months now take hours. Security reviews become database queries. 

 The trust tax disappears. 

 Nothing left to trust, only verify. 
###  ** Why This Moat Can't Be Copied ** 

 GitLab's architecture creates a flywheel that proprietary competitors cannot replicate: 

 ** The GitLab Trust Flywheel: ** 

 → Radical transparency attracts security-conscious enterprises 
 → These enterprises require specific compliance features 
 → They contribute features to pass their own audits 
 → Their contributions become social proof for peers 
 → More regulated industries adopt based on validation 
 → Each requirement strengthens the platform for that sector 

 The switching cost isn't technical. You can't retrofit radical transparency into a proprietary model. 

 ** You either give customers control or you don't. ** 

 Today: 1,344 customers paying over $100K annually. Ultimate tier with advanced governance represents 53% of ARR. The Dedicated offering, fully isolated instances grew 92% year-over-year to $50M ARR. 

 ** Enterprises aren't buying software. They're buying control. ** 

 The moat isn't the code. It's the collective investment of thousands of enterprises who've made GitLab theirs. 
###  ** Building Your Trust Infrastructure ** 

 Most vendors can't open-source their code. 
 But that's not the requirement. 

 What matters is making governance verifiable from day one. 

 ** For NewCos Building Trust Infrastructure: ** 

 ** Pick your transparency vector. ** Open-source code? Public roadmap? Published incident reports? Choose what you can sustain. 

 ** Make commitments permanent. ** Public documentation creates accountability. Not promises in sales calls. 

 ** Build audit trails by default. ** Every decision traceable. Not for compliance. For customer confidence. 

 ** Give customers their data. ** One-click exports. No support tickets. Their data, their control. 

 ** Eliminate gatekeepers. ** If customers need permission to verify your claims, you're doing it wrong. 

 ** The principle: Replace places where customers must "trust you" with places where they can verify for themselves. ** 

 GitLab didn't stumble into this accidentally. They deliberately used transparency as their wedge into enterprises. 

 Your advantage is learning from their playbook. 

 The companies that win won't be those with the best technology. They'll be those that relocate trust from promises to proof.

## Why Your 200 Job Applications Went Nowhere

#  Frame Break 
#  Why Your 200 Job Applications Went Nowhere 

 Inside the double disruption reshaping work 

 Usman Sheikh 

 Septemeber 10th, 2025 ​ 

 Everyone's swiping. Nobody's matching. 

 The game changed. The rules didn't. 

 ​ [ Annie Lowrey's article earlier this week captures what many are experiencing ] . Frustrated job seekers applying to hundreds of jobs and being ghosted every time; no rejections - only silence. ​ 

 She talks about candidates having perfect resumes: internships, volunteering, near-perfect GPAs and strong agency to do anything to get the job. Yet, the algorithm which screens them doesn't hire many. 

 ​ [ The hiring rate is at its lowest point since the 2002. ] ​ 

 Where Bumble and Hinge broke dating. 
 Now the same mechanics are breaking hiring. 

 My news feeds have been awash with articles around how August added just 22,000 jobs to the US economy. June turned negative - first time since 2020. [ Then yesterday BLS quietly revised away 911,000 jobs that never existed. ] ​ 
###  Alternative Timeline 

 In another timeline, while tech employment continues to contract at a blistering pace, output has been rapidly increasing. In 60+ years of data tracking, this level of divergence has never happened. [ Companies are achieving record productivity with fewer people ] . ​ 

 This isn't a recession signal - it's evidence of a structural transformation. 

 Everyone's treating this like a normal downturn, waiting for the "recovery." But when cyclical weakness ends, the structural changes remain. [ Those jobs aren't coming back. ] ​ 
###  ** Evidence is Building ** 

 ​ [ Coinbase: 40% of daily code is AI-generated. ] ​ 
 ​ [ Eight Sleep: 48% and climbing. ] ​ 

 Every tech company racing to similar numbers. 

 ** The old question: ** "How many people do you employ?" 
 ​ ** The new question: ** "What's your output per employee?" 

 This shift isn't limited to Silicon Valley. Eventually every business needs to embrace technology or get left behind. 

 The [ lean AI leaderboards track billion-dollar companies ] with single-digit employees. Hiring rapidly is now looked upon as a negative signal rather than a positive one. 

 One of our e-commerce companies we launched last year has [ hit a $2m run-rate with the founder being the only full-time employee ] . He has used a mix of fractional employees and automation to ruthlessly optimize the business. 

 Team size is trending down in most of my fastest growing portfolio companies while wages for each full-time employee are increasing. 
###  ** The Double Disruption ** 

 Yes, the economy faces genuine cyclical weakness. Tariffs disrupted supply chains. Rate uncertainty froze decisions. The traditional recession signals are real. 

 But underneath lurks the structural transformation. [ Junior roles down 23%. Senior roles up 14%. ] The middle is vanishing - not temporarily, but permanently. 

 ​ [ A recent viral Substack piece captured it perfectly: corporate jobs have become "elaborate performance art." ] People forwarding emails about meetings about strategies that don't matter. 

 Everyone knows. Everyone pretends. 

 Meanwhile, the real economy shifts to contractors, freelancers, fractional talent. Geographic barriers dissolve. Global talent pools compete for every opportunity. 

 The theatrical corporate middle is subsidizing its own replacement. 

 ​ [ This is the coordination failure I wrote about last month. ] Everyone sees the absurdity. No one can individually defect. Companies that try to preserve the old model lose to those embracing the new one. 
###  ** The New Reality ** 

 We're in the messy middle. [ One timeline experiences AI exuberance ] - tech valuations soaring, productivity exploding, the future arriving daily. Another timeline pays for it through vanishing jobs and obsolete skills. 

 History shows bubbles do critical work. They finance infrastructure nobody would rationally build. [ The railroad bubble created tracks we still use. ] [ The dot-com bubble laid fiber optics. ] Today's AI bubble? Building the cognitive infrastructure for whatever comes next. 

 The major shift this time is that we are [ unbundling the corporate job ] , it won't rebundle the same way. The new equilibrium won't resurrect middle management or restore credential-based gatekeeping. 

 Value creation and capture will follow new patterns. 

 The job market isn't broken. It's being replaced while we measure what no longer matters. 

 Some recognize both timelines exist - the exuberance and the exodus. They build for the new equilibrium while navigating the current chaos. 

 Others will wait for recovery, sending their 201st application and then  wonder why silence is the only response. 

 All of us are currently living through a civilizational transition we can't fully comprehend. Like workers watching the first factories rise during industrialization, we sense the magnitude but can't see the destination. 

 The bubble will burst. But the infrastructure will remain. New forms of value creation will emerge from the wreckage. 

 History doesn't repeat, but it rhythms. 

 And in that messy middle, where the old rules died but new ones haven't crystallized, we're all just trying to find our place in a game whose rules are being written as we play. 

 Currently most are still swiping. 
 But that game may be coming to an abrupt end.

#  Frame Break 
#  MongoDB's Whiplash Year 

 When the market mistakes noise for signal 

 Usman Sheikh 

 Sep 9th, 2025 ​ 

 MongoDB fell 50%. Then surged 100%. 
 This isn't volatility. It's fragility. 

 MongoDB sells metered database access through Atlas. Like AWS, the meter spins when customers use more. 

 ** Early 2025: ** Stock crashed to $147 as growth decelerated. 
 ​ ** September 2025: ** Trading at $323 after surging 40% on earnings. ​ 

 Q2 FY26 numbers that triggered the surge: 
 ​ ** → Revenue: ** $591M (+24% YoY) 
 ​ ** → Atlas growth: ** Accelerated to 29% (from 26% in Q1) 
 ​ ** → Operating margin: ** 15% (beat ~10% guide) 
 ​ ** → Notable customer: ** Major autonomous vehicle company chose Atlas for mission-critical systems 

 One earnings report resulted in a 40% stock move. The market desperately wanted this to mean something. 

 ** The Signal Everyone Wants to See ** 

 The stock movements seem to have a pattern. When Atlas accelerates, AI applications are scaling. When it slows, the boom is ending. 

 The logic feels bulletproof, AI needs massive computing and MongoDB charges by consumption. Therefore, MongoDB tracks AI adoption. 

 That autonomous vehicle customer strengthened the narrative. This isn't some startup experiment. It's mission-critical systems. 

 Yet, the surge wasn't about MongoDB. The market was buying confirmation that AI has graduated from demos to production. 

 ** The Noise Nobody Wants to Acknowledge ** 

 The inherent lumpiness of consumption businesses make them terrible proxies. One large customer can swing an entire quarter. 

 That autonomous vehicle company, while validating MongoDB's technology, could also explain most of the 3% acceleration. Next quarter, if they optimize spending or another customer churns, growth could reverse just as dramatically. 

 MongoDB faces additional complications. A $40M headwind from expiring licenses. A new CFO cutting costs aggressively. Gross margins declining as Atlas grows. Each adds noise unrelated to AI adoption. 

 The market treats this as broad adoption when growth could be entirely concentrated in a few accounts. 

 ** Why This Fragility Feels Different ** 

 Markets have always overreacted to new technology narratives. Railroad stocks or even early internet companies. The difference now? 

 The speed and violence of the swings. 

 MongoDB's 100% reversal in six months would have taken much longer in previous cycles. Every earnings call triggers binary repricing. Every data point gets tortured for meaning. 

 This isn't price discovery. It is the market grasping for certainty in chaos, treating any data as definitive because admitting ignorance isn't an option. 

 ** The Next Quarter's Trap ** 

 If Q3 decelerates, the narrative will flip instantly. AI was overhyped. Enterprises aren't adopting and the stock crashes again. 

 But deceleration might come from consumption lumpiness, license headwinds or customers optimizing their spend. None relate to AI's trajectory, but the market won't distinguish. 

 It needs MongoDB to be a signal, even when it's mostly noise. 

 ** The Bottom Line ** 

 MongoDB's violent year isn't about MongoDB. It's about a market so desperate for AI clarity that it searches every earnings report for answers that aren't there. 

 The autonomous vehicle account win is real. But whether this represents broad AI adoption or isolated wins remains unknowable from one quarter's data. 

 The 100% surge and 50% crash are the same phenomenon: a market that has replaced patient analysis with anxious pattern-matching, mistaking correlation for causation at unprecedented speed. 

 That isn't investing, it is anxiety dressed up as a ticker symbol.

#  From Selling Hours to Building Rails 

 How NewCo turns services into compounding assets 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 8th, 2025 ​ 

 Talent flees LegacyCo knowing it's broken. 
 Then rebuilds it smaller without realizing. 

 ** Every Friday, your businesses knowledge walks out the door. ** 

 You prepped three clients for audits this quarter. Same evidence folders, same exception explanations. Each time you started from scratch, billed for discovery, then delivered. 

 The knowledge didn't vanish entirely. It lives in your people and in templates you'll adapt next time. You'll change the client name and tweak the methodology. Some residue remains. 

 But the actual resolution gets rebuilt every time. ** Because the business model is selling hours, not encoding patterns. ** 

 This is the leak that defines LegacyCo and most boutiques. 

 You're not starting from zero, but you're not compounding either. You're stuck at 20% reuse when you could be at 80%. 
###  The False Escape 

 Talented people flee Big4 hoping to do things better. Eighteen months later, most have built a boutique with the same fundamental flaw: knowledge doesn't compound. 

 For some, this is the goal. Premium clients and intellectual challenges. There is nothing wrong with that choice. 

 But if you left to build something different - something that scales beyond trading time for money - you've recreated what you fled. Just with fewer people and better margins. 

 ** There is another way. ** 
###  The Encoding Discipline 

 ** NewCo's first discipline: ** encode every resolution into reusable rails. 

 Not documentation. Not templates. Rails: the resolution logic itself, ready to deploy with governance built in. 

 When I was selling HR tech to enterprises, every company sent me those same security questionnaires. I'd spend days filling out nearly identical forms for each prospect. 

 The absurdity: thousands of vendors answering the same questions from scratch. 

 ​ [ Vanta saw this pattern and built rails. ] ​ 

 Instead of consultants rebuilding compliance documentation for each client, they encoded the requirements once. What used to take weeks of billable hours became continuous infrastructure. 

 A true NewCo would go further: ** encode the requirements and stake their fee on the outcome. Rails plus bounded accountability. ** 

 This is the NewCo model. Pick an operational burden that everyone faces and [ build rails that encode the solution once ] and improve with every client. 

 This isn't strategy work. McKinsey keeps the C-suite transformations. 

 This is operational plumbing with objective right answers that enables businesses to move faster and focus on their core. 
###  Why Most Default 

 "Every client is unique" - true for strategy, false for operational patterns. 

 By client twenty, you've made a choice without realizing it. You've hired deliverers, not encoders. [ You're measuring utilization rates instead of pattern reuse ] . Pricing by time because that's what generates immediate cash. 

 Most default to what they know - familiar model, flowing invoices. But you're building a smaller version of what you left. 

 The alternative requires intention from day one. 

 Hiring people who think in systems, not engagements. Measuring [ pattern reuse velocity ] and propagation time, not billable hours. Accepting lower margins initially while you build the rails. 
###  The Compound Path 

 Your first ten clients fund pattern discovery. By client thirty, rails handle half the work and you've shifted from hourly to outcome pricing. By client 100, rails handle 80% automatically. 

 You're selling subscriptions, not time. 

 What takes LegacyCo five people becomes a one-person oversight role. Not because you're more efficient. Because you're building a different asset entirely. 

 Every client makes the rails smarter. Your competitors start from zero each time. You start from wherever the last client advanced the system. 
###  Why LegacyCo Can't Copy 

 Their incentives reward billable hours, not encoded patterns. Their structure creates compliance barriers, not shared rails. 

 They serve complex global enterprises with human-scaled solutions. 

 They need massive scale because they solve every problem, everywhere. NewCo picks one operational burden - vendor questionnaires or revenue recognition - and encodes it completely. 

 ** One domain, total depth. ** 

 Different games entirely. They'll acquire NewCos rather than build them. It's the only move that makes sense given their structure. 
###  The Choice 

 Pick your operational burden with intention. It must be large enough to matter. Small problems create small companies. Big shared burdens create monopolies. 

 ** The discipline is simple: encode every resolution or accept you're selling hours forever. ** 

 The choice comes down to the type of company you want to build.

#  The Infinite Wager 

 Trading now for never 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 7th, 2025 ​ 

 We sacrifice the present for promises that were never guaranteed. 

 The corporate job promised security until layoffs came. 
 Startups promise exits that rarely happen. 
 ​ [ Credentials promised access to opportunities that no longer exist. ] ​ 

 Each sacrifice assumed returns that were never certain. 

 You are reading this post hoping it contains something useful for tomorrow. Even this moment becomes currency for a future one. 

 Try to stop wagering and watch what happens. "I'll be present" - presence becomes the next achievement. "I'll be happy now" - happiness becomes the next goal. 

 The mind cannot rest in what is. It must make what is into a bridge to what might be. 

 This isn't a flaw you can fix. The one trying to fix it is what causes it - thought trying to repair thought. 

 ** The infinite wager isn't something you're doing wrong. It's what thought does - constantly exchanging now for then. ** 

 When you see this completely - not as concept but as what's actually happening - the whole game becomes visible. 

 When the full game is visible, you can't be played by it the same way. 

 ** Reflection for the week: ** What are you trading this moment for?

#  Stateless 

 When professional belonging disappears, what remains? 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 6th, 2025 ​ 

 The unbundling of the corporate job carries a hidden cost. 

 Beneath the fractures - skill acquisition moving to YouTube, credentials to GitHub, economics to gig platforms - we lost the answer to our deepest need: where do we belong. 

 ** Credentials weren't just proof. They were membership cards. ** 

 The corporate bundle didn't simply organize work. It answered a need encoded since humans first formed tribes. Belonging meant survival. 

 ** Exile meant death. ** ​ 
 That fear never left us. 

 When the bundle breaks, we don't just lose a job. We lose our answer to the oldest question: ** What tribe claims me? ** 

 The answer used to be simple. 

 "I work at Goldman" or "I'm a marketer" or "I'm a senior developer" - these weren't job descriptions. They were passports. Everyone understood your place, your value. 

 When someone asks "What do you do?" and you answer "I'm between things" the body reads their confusion as rejection. 

 Cortisol spikes. Heartbeat quickens. 

 An alarm older than language fires: You are an outsider. 

 For 300,000 years, that alarm meant death. No shared hunt. No warmth against winter. Today the stakes are different. The wiring is identical. 

 ** The job was the professional tribe. ** 

 After leaving, you live between names. Every label feels like a lie. 

 Consultant? Only if one project counts.Founder? Nothing founded yet.  Advisor? To whom exactly? You rotate between descriptions depending on who's asking. That's stateless. 

 "I'm between things" means nothing concrete to point to yet. You exist in the space between categories. 

 The body knows what stateless meant for our ancestors. 

 I know. I lived this exile for a decade. 

 For years I built ventures that [ produced nothing that signified success ] while peers raced ahead. 

 The shame wasn't about failure. Failure within a tribe is forgivable - the  analyst who botches a model still belongs at Goldman. ** My shame was having no witnesses to my effort. No context for my struggle. ** 

 I spent a decade answering "What do you do?" with increasing incoherence. 

 First: "I run a psychometric assessment company." Blank stares. 
 Then: "I'm building software for remote-first companies." Confusion. 

 Eventually I stopped explaining. 

 "I'm working on a startup" became my default. 

 ​ [ Each venture was supposed to be the passport in. ] Each failure pushed me deeper into professional statelessness. My friends at consulting firms got promoted. My peers at banks became VPs. 

 ** I became harder to place. ** 

 Some tried consulting. Others freelanced. A few kept building startups. Different tactics, same exile. We all existed outside recognized tribes. 

 This is where shame lives - in the gap between leaving and arriving. 

 ​ [ The shame compounds ] : 
 Maybe I'm delusional about my capabilities. 
 Maybe I need to pivot. 
 Maybe I'm not cut out for this. 
 Maybe I should go back. 

 You post "working on something new" while browsing corporate job listings at 2am, wondering if three years is too long a gap to explain. 

 The performance exhausts you. 

 Old colleagues reach out: "How are things going?" You craft responses that sound like progress without lying outright. 

 The truth is you haven't figured it out yet. 

 Meanwhile, your former peers post their witnessed wins - promotions, deals, headcount growth. 

 Yours happen alone, if at all. A client closes and there's no one to tell. A feature ships and there's no celebration. 

 You exist in the space between tribes. Not failed enough to quit. Not successful enough to belong. The space between categories where shame compounds daily. 

 ** Outside a tribe, effort doesn't exist. Only results do. And only if someone else says so. ** 

 That's how tribes always operated - through external validation. Without these markers, you didn't exist professionally. 

 But we're entering a world where the stateless population will grow. Those external validation signals will weaken. Smaller tribes will form around different forces - shared obsessions and beliefs. 

 Not based on where you worked or what you did but what you can't stop thinking about. 

 This isn't resolution. Most in the stateless zone won't find these tribes immediately, if ever. They'll spend years pretending to have it figured out, secretly longing for tribes that no longer exist. 

 The question isn't whether you'll experience this exile, but how you'll navigate it. Will you exhaust yourself seeking readmission to tribes that no longer recognize you or exist? 

 The corporate bundle is fracturing. 
 More join the stateless every month. 

 ** The question remains: What tribe claims you now? **

#  The Unbundling of the Corporate Job 

 Everyone's searching for a bundle that no longer exists 

 Usman Sheikh 

 Septemeber 5th, 2025 ​ 

 The corporate job still exists. 
 But everyone knows it's not the same deal anymore. 

 ​ [ After my credential collapse post ] , dozens of messages poured in from professionals at every stage - all asking the same thing: 

 ** 'What comes next?' ** 

 Before answering that, we need to understand something: ** the corporate job was always just a bundle, ** [ ** like cable TV ** ] ** . ** And like every bundle technology touches, it's getting unbundled. 

 The components still exist, just scattered everywhere. 

 Instead of searching for what comes next, we need to understand what was in the bundle in the first place. 
###  Anatomy of the Old Bundle 

 The corporate job delivered four things in one package: 

 ** Skills: ** You learned through proximity. Watching someone navigate Excel badly until you figured out better ways. Sitting silent in client meetings until you understood the dynamics. Knowledge transferred through osmosis, not instruction. 

 ** Judgment: ** You developed instincts through contained failures. The project that imploded taught you to spot weak requirements. Your mistakes had consequences but weren't fatal - someone senior could still save it. 

 ** Credentials: ** Time became proof. Two years at McKinsey meant something. The market couldn't evaluate capability, so it evaluated tenure - survival as proxy for skill. But tenure gave you more than credibility. Your coworkers became your professional network by default. One email from your corporate address opened doors. 

 ** Economics: ** Predictable salary progression. 5% raises, occasional promotions. Enough to build a life and pay down debt. 

 This bundle was inefficient but complete. You overpaid in time to get everything in one place. 
###  The Violent Unbundling 

 Here's what replaced each component: 

 ** Skills: ** [ YouTube & AI tutors ] - [ infinite teachers ] at every level. The abundance is real, navigation is chaos. 

 ** Judgment: ** The market becomes your teacher - instant, brutal feedback replacing patient mentorship. But these create different types entirely. [ Market feedback builds people who ship ] . Corporate mentorship trained people to navigate complexity. We're losing the second type. Maybe that's fine if hierarchies are collapsing. 

 ** Credentials: ** GitHub commits, client testimonials, newsletter subscribers, Behance portfolios - public work replacing private tenure. You can reach anyone globally but without the automatic trust of a shared corporate background. The new signals are emerging. Markets are still learning to read them. 

 ** Economics: ** Work pays by outcome, not hours. Some weeks you earn your old monthly salary. Others, nothing. Freedom to choose projects, responsibility of choosing wisely. 

 Each component is theoretically better but scattered across platforms with no coordination. 
###  The Navigation Problem 

 This sounds like progress. But look at who's trying to navigate it. 

 Take a 22-year-old graduating today. They don't know if they should build depth or breadth. Whether GitHub commits matter more than Upwork testimonials. If they need a bootcamp certificate or just shipped products. 

 ** The old system: ** Join company, climb ladder, develop expertise. 
 ​ ** The new system: ** Infinite options, no map. 

 Everyone's panicking, looking for Corporate Job 2.0 - the new institution that packages everything together. 

 When cable unbundled, we didn't find better cable. It gave rise to Netflix, TikTok, YouTube - different services for different needs. But with careers, people are still searching for the all-in-one package. 

 The search for a new bundle is the trap. 

 Most can't design their own development path - they've never had to. The [ cognitive cost of assembling your own bundle is enormous ] . Those with high agency and comfort with ambiguity will thrive. 
###  The Reframe 

 The ones who succeed won't find a bundle. They'll create one. 

 The shift is from consumer to curator. From package recipient to component assembler. The designer using AI for production speed, Behance for portfolio, fractional work for revenue. 

 The writer combining Substack for audience, cohort courses for income, Twitter for distribution. Their "credential" is their email list. 

 These aren't perfect paths. They're experiments. But they share one trait: the individuals stopped waiting for permission or packages. They started assembling components based on what they actually needed. 

 ** This requires a different mindset. Not "where do I apply?" but "what do I build?" Not "who will train me?" but "what do I need to learn?" ** 

 The winners won't be those who find the best institution. They'll be those who become their own bundler. 

 They'll have built reputations through visible work, not invisible tenure - and learned from anyone, anywhere, not just whoever sat next to them. 

 The unbundling feels like collapse because we're in the messy middle. 

 The old system is crumbling but still standing. 
 The new system is rising but the patterns aren't clear. 

 Most will wait for someone to package the solution - and a massive re-bundling market will emerge. They will sell the promise of curation, of taking the integrator burden off your shoulders. 

 No single bundle will replace what we lost. Instead, we'll get new packaged versions for most, and self-assembled paths for the few. 

 ** Not everyone can self-assemble. Not everyone will. ** 

 But that confused 22 year old isn't lost - they are early to a game where the rules are still being written.

#  Case Study #20: Credit Rails 

 How Affirm turned credit complexity into operating infrastructure 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 4th, 2025 ​ 

 San Francisco, 2012. 

 Max Levchin sits across from a prominent banker who controls billions in credit assets. 

 ** "You're nuts. Half my profit comes from late fees." ** 

 "Great," Levchin replies. [ "Zero of mine will come from there." ] ​ 

 The banker laughed. Every credit business monetizes mistakes: overdrafts, late payments. [ It's the industry's worst-kept secret: profits depend on customers failing. ] ​ 

 ​ [ Levchin had built PayPal. He understood payments. ] But watching the 2008 crisis taught him something else: a generation now hated credit cards. They'd seen parents crushed by compounding debt. 

 His constraint was radical: no late fees, no penalty interest, ever. If customers borrowed $1,000 with $15 interest, they'd pay exactly $1,015, even if late. 

 This forced Affirm to build different infrastructure. 
 ​ [ Not features. Operating rails. ] ​ 

 Today Affirm processes tens of billions annually with 92% repeat usage. ​ 
###  ** Transaction Unbundling ** 

 ** The key to understanding Affirm's innovation is this: they unbundled the universal credit line into individual transaction decisions. ** 

 Traditional credit cards give you one $10,000 line approved once, based on a snapshot of your credit score. 

 Use it anywhere, for anything, forever. 

 Affirm makes a fresh credit decision for every single purchase. A $500 Peloton bike gets analyzed differently than $500 at Supreme. 

 The merchant matters. 
 The product category matters. 
 Your history with similar purchases matters. 

 They process tens of millions of these micro-decisions annually. Each transaction stands alone with its own terms, its own risk assessment, its own repayment schedule. 

 But how could they possibly make this work at scale? 
###  ** The Three Operating Rails ** 

 Affirm built three interlocking rails to make transaction-level underwriting work at scale. 

 ** The Mathematical Rail ** 

 By removing fee revenue, Levchin fundamentally changed the company's loss function: 

 ** Traditional credit: ** Profit = Underwriting + Fee_Income 
 ​ ** Affirm's model: ** Profit = Underwriting_Accuracy - Cost_of_Capital 

 No buffer. No crutch. Every default directly hits the bottom line. 

 This constraint forced excellence. Affirm built models trained on over 215 million labeled transactions. Each repayment or default feeds back into the system, making tomorrow's decisions better than today's. 

 ** This massive dataset of real outcomes is the true moat. ** A competitor can copy the no-fee policy tomorrow, but they can't replicate a decade of labeled transaction data. 

 ** The Legal Rail ** 

 Beneath the ML rails is regulatory infrastructure that took years to build. 

 Fifty different state usury laws with varying maximum rates. State-by-state lending licenses. Partner bank relationships for loan origination. 

 Affirm absorbed this complexity so merchants never touch it. One click activates credit across all jurisdictions. The merchant doesn't need to know that jurisdictional caps vary. 

 Affirm handles it all. 

 This unglamorous legal scaffolding is another moat. Building it takes years of patient, expensive work that most competitors won't endure. 

 ** The Capital Rail ** 

 Code doesn't fund loans. Money does. 

 Affirm built multiple funding sources: warehouse lines for immediate liquidity, forward-flow agreements with institutional buyers, and asset-backed securities (ABS) for seasoned loans. 

 As loans age and prove themselves, they move through these layers, freeing up capacity for new purchases. 

 When one funding source tightens, others compensate. The rails keep running regardless of capital market conditions. 

 These three rails interlock and reinforce each other. 

 → ** Better underwriting attracts more capital. 
 ​ ** → ** More capital enables volume. 
 ​ ** → ** Volume improves models. ** ​ 
 ​ 
 ​ ** The system compounds its own advantages. ** 

 Affirm didn't make credit cheaper. They didn't add better rewards or lower rates. They absorbed the complexity that everyone else pushes onto users and merchants. 

 They turned that absorption into operating rails that get smarter with scale. Every transaction teaches the system. Every merchant integration strengthens the network. Every funding partnership adds resilience. 

 ** This is the NewCo playbook: Don't optimize the existing system. Build new rails that make the old system irrelevant. ** 

 Your competitors are still monetizing friction. Your opportunity is eliminating it entirely. 

 Don't optimize the tax. Delete it and rebuild the system on operating rails around its absence.

## The Credential Collapse Has Started

#  The Credential Collapse Has Started 

 Research shows AI adopters cut mid-tier graduates by 22% 

 Usman Sheikh 

 Septemeber 3rd, 2025 ​ 

 Months ago [ I wrote about no demand for average. ] ​ 
 Recent research reveals the problem is deeper. 

 ​ [ Harvard economists recently published research profiling 62 million workers. ] They found early AI adopting firms cut junior hiring by 22% overall, with wholesale and retail sectors seeing even steeper declines. 

 The research showed a pattern where elite universities saw minimal impact. Bottom-tier schools survived as well. It was the Tier 2 and Tier 3 schools - the "good enough" universities that produce most white-collar workers saw the steepest entry-level hiring declines. 

 It's not no demand for average 

 It is no entry for average credentials. 
###  ** The Credential Collapse ** 

 When hiring drops 22% but only for certain schools, we're witnessing ** credential collapse - when direct proof-of-work (portfolios and experience) becomes more predictive than degree signals, markets reprice mid-tier credentials first. ** 

 For decades, a Tier 2 or 3 degree guaranteed entry into management training programs, consulting, banking. Companies hired assuming they could train competence into expertise. 

 That assumption is slowly starting to break. Companies are discovering they can do more with less. 

 For a 26-year-old with $120k in debt from a Tier 2 MBA, this isn't theory. They are discovering the credential they bet their future on no longer opens doors. 

 ** The bar for entry-level just went up. ** 

 Meanwhile, universities keep producing graduates with the same systems while demand evaporates. 
###  ** How Firms Are Responding ** 

 The research showed AI adopting firms promoting existing juniors 0.4 times faster per quarter. These firms are leaning on AI-augmented productivity as a substitute for developed judgment. 

 They're making a critical error. 

 A junior with AI can build financial models. Can they spot when assumptions don't match reality because the macro shifted? 

 ** Expertise isn't using tools. It's knowing when the tools are wrong. ** 

 Expertise is what stays human: 

 → ** Recognizing edge cases ** where output looks perfect but isn't 
 → ** Defining which problems ** to solve and what questions to ask 
 → ** Synthesizing ** ** across different contexts ** to see the full picture 
 → ** Detecting subtle environment changes ** and its impact 

 Promoting tool-fluent juniors into judgment roles borrows against tomorrow's expertise. It works once; it doesn't compound. 

 Every company cutting juniors today will scramble for seniors tomorrow. Seniors who won't exist because everyone made the same bet. 

 But internal promotion can't solve everything. Firms still need fresh talent. Without credentials as a filter, how do they evaluate outsiders? 
###  ** The Scale Problem ** 

 For decades, firms hired juniors using GPA, extracurriculars, internships and interview performance. ** University credentials were the scalable filter - not efficient, but it worked at volume. ** 

 If companies stop reading resumes and start running auditions the review workload explodes. That's the bottleneck the old credential system absorbed. Firms know they need expertise have no mechanism to identify it at entry level. 

 ​ [ A few months ago I wrote about Julia Fedorin, who got hired by Shopify through a video pitch. ] Agency demonstration at its best. While inspiring, it reveals the problem: this doesn't scale. 

 When 1,000 candidates submit portfolios for one role, who reviews them? How do you verify the work is theirs? 

 ** The most likely outcome will be the rise of new intermediaries. Portfolio verification services and structured evaluation systems. ** 

 Same gatekeeping, repackaged. 

 We're not eliminating credentialism. We're replacing university degrees with work samples and side projects. Different credential, same game. 
###  ** In Between Systems ** 

 The credential collapse isn't coming. 
 Among the 3.7% of early AI adopters, it's here. 

 We find ourselves between systems. 

 ** The old path ** - degree, junior role, steady promotion - is breaking. 

 ** A new path ** - portfolio, paid audition, accelerated development - exists in pockets but isn't systemic. 

 When more companies adopt AI, mid-tier credentials won't recover their pricing power. Verified output will replace them. 

 This transition won't be smooth. Some will adapt early - building demonstrable expertise, creating value without permission. They'll thrive in the chaos. 

 Most are still climbing a ladder that no longer exists, unaware the rungs above them have already vanished. 

 ** Credentials were always a proxy for competence. ** 

 The proxy stopped working. 
 Now we find out who needed the proxy and who never did.

## Box’s Invisible Moat

#  Frame Break 
#  Box's Permission Graph 

 The permission graph driving 28% operating margins 

 Usman Sheikh 

 Sep 2nd, 2025 ​ 

 Everyone's racing to build AI agents. 

 Few are thinking about data permissions. 

 Box spent two decades building a boring moat: a detailed map of who can touch what document, when, why, and with what proof. 

 This invisible metadata layer is now a key moat against irrelevance. 

 ** Q2 FY26 scorecard: ** ​ 
 → Revenue: $294M (+9% YoY) 
 → Gross margin: 81.4% 
 → Operating margin: 28.6% 
 → Net retention: 103% 
 → Enterprise Advanced: 10% of revenue (up from 5%) ​ 

 This is a slow-growth, high-margin machine at a crossroads where data and access control are at the heart of the AI scaling debate. 
###  ** The Permission Graph Explained ** 

 Every document in Box has a shadow document: its permission metadata. Who created it, who modified it, who can access it, what compliance rules govern it, which systems can call it. 

 When an AI agent requests a contract, it doesn't simply need the PDF. It needs proof it's allowed to see it, verification it's the right version, and an audit trail of what it did with it. 

 Twenty years of accumulated governance decisions that can't be easily replicated or migrated. 

 ** Why The Permission Graph Matters Now ** 

 ​ [ Levie recently told CNBC ] : "If you don't maintain access controls well, AI agents will find the wrong information - leading to wrong answers or security incidents." 

 ** Every enterprise faces the same AI deployment crisis: ** ​ 
 → Data scattered with inconsistent permissions 
 → No unified governance for AI agents 
 → One breach risking entire AI initiative 
 → Regulatory compliance becoming mandatory 

 The permission graph solves this. Box knows it. 
###  ** The Push towards Context Control ** 

 ​ [ Enterprise Advanced launched at the start of the year ] : AI agents, workflow automation, document generation. They are rapidly adding contextual layers on top of documents because they see the same future everyone does. AI agents calling their API for documents while users never see Box. 

 Microsoft owns the experience. Box becomes plumbing. 

 This push is their attempt to stay visible, to own some piece of the user experience. But it's still Product Rails, not [ Operating Rails ] . 

 They're adding features and workflow automation tools to documents, not doubling down on building moats around their permission graph. 

 ** The Control Point Question ** 

 Their one defensible asset: the permission graph. 

 ​ [ The bull case assumes this control point is valuable enough ] . That enterprises will pay for bulletproof data governance and data storage neutrality even if the contextual transformations happens elsewhere. 

 The bear case assumes graph moat fragility. A hyperscaler could acquire or parnter with the likes of [ Varonis ] & [ Cloudfuze ] to recreate the permission graph. 

 The moat isn't as deep as it looks. 
###  ** Every SaaS Company's Dilemma ** 

 Box isn't alone in this crisis. Every legacy SaaS faces the same question: how do you avoid becoming invisible infrastructure in an agentic world? 

 They're all trying the same failing playbook. Add AI features, claim to be "AI-native," hope the moat holds. 

 Box's advantage: the permission graph is genuinely hard to replicate. 
 Box's disadvantage: they still think like a document storage company. 

 ** Markets View ** 

 Box owns twenty years of permission metadata that makes deploying the latest AI upgrades safe. At 81% gross margins, these returns exist  on commodity storage because of the permission graph. 

 The market is valuing the business at 24x forward P/E and has not ascribed the graph premium to the company. 

 The other factor is that Box is led by Aaron Levie. He's a founder who's spent two decades obsessing over one problem: enterprise content governance. 

 ​ [ That obsession matters now more than ever. ] ​ 

 The question isn't whether the permission graph has value. It's whether Box can deepen the moat before others make it irrelevant.

## Operating Rails Monetize Mistakes, Not Features

#  Operating Rails Monetize Mistakes, Not Features 

 Why error correction velocity is the new competitive moat 

 Usman Sheikh 

 September 1st, 2025 ​ 

 SaaS monetizes features. Rails monetize mistakes. 

 ​ [ Last week's main objection to Operating Rails was ] : "Isn't this just network effects? Won't fast followers catch up?" 

 ** No. Rails don't create network effects. 
 They create learning effects. ** 

 Every time work flows through the rail, it doesn't only deliver an outcome, it makes the rail smarter. 

 SaaS scaled revenue. 
 Consulting scaled judgment. 
 Rails scale error correction. 

 While legacy firms bolt AI agents onto existing workflows, NewCos who understand this shift build differently. 

 You can't buy five years of resolved edge cases or compress an audit trail of failures. ** That compound learning of every error fixed, every pattern learned becomes the moat. ** 
###  ** Learning Effects > Network Effects ** 

 Classic SaaS defensibility came from network effects. Slack gains utility with more teammates. But SaaS compounding is bounded. 

 ** Each instance learns locally. ** 

 Operating Rails compound differently. Every GitHub Copilot rejection, every Stripe fraud flag, every CrowdStrike attack blocked, they all make the entire network smarter. 

 An example is Expensify. When you correct a miscategorized expense, it only improves your workspace, despite 15 million users generating errors daily. 

 ** Result: down 92% from peak, now at $181M market cap. ** ​ 

 ** Now imagine Expensify as a Rail: ** every correction across thousands of companies teaching the entire network. Your operating costs benchmarked against similar companies. Edge cases from one company preventing errors at another. 

 ** This isn't about user count. It's about work count. ** 

 Every pattern resolved becomes reusable logic with provenance. 
 Rails monetize mistakes across the network. 
 SaaS monetizes features in isolation. 

 This difference isn't accidental. 
###  ** The Three Laws of Operating Rails ** 

 ** Law 1: Learn faster than they copy ** 
 Your rail must improve faster than competitors can imitate. A competitor can copy your features in weeks. They can't compress five years of edge cases resolved, versioned, and rolled back. The moat isn't what you built; it's how fast you compound. 

 ** Law 2: Make it tacit, not portable ** 
 Perfect documentation is easily copyable. The real moat lives in tacit knowledge, patterns that only work with your specific context, governance, and audit trails. Like a master chef's recipe that fails without their exact timing and adjustments. 

 ** Law 3: Power without transparency kills trust ** 
 As rails automate more decisions, they need more governance. One bad auto-execution can destroy years of trust. Constitutions, vetoes, one-click rollbacks - these aren't nice-to-haves. They are a must. Lose trust once and contributions slow. When contributions slow, compounding dies. 

 Understanding these laws changes how you build. 
###  ** NewCo Playbook: Start Boring, Compound Fast ** 

 Most NewCos I speak with default to human leverage as they begin to  scale. ** They become legacy cos with better branding. ** The winners understand: half of every company is shared burden work ripe for Rails. 

 Start with the unglamorous: invoice reconciliation, expense categorization, compliance checks. Expensify owns the problem but not the solution - they correct errors locally, missing the chance to compound learning across 15 million users. 

 The critical insight: ** distribution feeds the rail, but the rail creates the moat. ** You need work flowing through the system to generate errors to learn from. Expensify has the distribution but keeps learning local. A NewCo with rails thinking could acquire that distribution. They'd buy the users, not the learning because the learning doesn't exist yet. 

 ** The playbook: ** Target boring problems with fast feedback loops. Build trust through bounded liability. Let error correction compound. Every competitor starting later faces non-compressible time. 

 They can copy features. They can't compress failures. 

 The winners won't be the ones who automate fastest. They'll be the ones who learn from failure fastest. 

 ** LegacyCos are adding AI agents to their workflows, hoping for magic. ** But intelligence in local instances doesn't compound, you don't build moats by making each silo smarter. 

 NewCos who grasp Operating Rail laws will target the boring shared burdens. They'll turn every error into network intelligence. They'll shoulder bounded liability to earn trust. And they'll compound learning at rates LegacyCo can't match. 

 ** Strong operators compound errors into moats. 
 Weak operators add features and hope. ** 

 ​ [ Friday we explored the opportunity around finding where AI fails. ] ​ 

 Today we showed how to monetize those failures at scale - by ** owning the fastest, safest error-correction loop in your domain. **

#  The Tension We Feel 

 When focus pulls you away from everything else 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 31st, 2025 ​ 

 There's a tension that comes with deep work. You feel it in your body every time someone interrupts. 

 When life demands attention but your mind stays locked on a problem you are deeply engrossed in solving. 

 ** Flow in the moment feels effortless, meaningful. ** 

 The tension arrives with interruption - when solving tomorrow's problems means missing today's moments. 

 I notice the tension most when I'm interrupted by something that matters - after I've already said 'just five more minutes' twice, and my family needs my attention. 

 A conversation that won't wait, a moment that won't come again. The irritation, the mental resistance to shift gears. 

 ** That resistance isn't protecting the work. ** It's protecting the story that the work is more valuable than the life it's supposed to serve. 

 The tension will always be there when you care deeply about anything. The question is whether you are aware of its cost. 

 ** Reflection for the week: ** What moment did you miss this week because you couldn't let go of the work?

#  Patterns That Own You 

 What are you defending right now? 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 30th, 2025 ​ 

 I spent decades accumulating patterns. 
 Each one made me faster, more efficient. 

 But certainty causes blindness. 

 ​ [ There's a moment when expertise flips into the curse of competence ] . The very patterns that made me successful started filtering out reality. I stopped seeing what was actually happening because I already "knew" what was supposed to happen. 

 ** Knowing is memory speaking ** , efficient and blind. 

 ** Seeing is when the commentary stops ** , awareness without a filter. 

 Yesterday a startup founder was telling me about his problem. Immediately my pattern-matching kicked in: "I've seen this before." 

 But I wasn't seeing his reality. I was replaying my past. 

 The same thing happened in my relationships. I had a model for how to interact. It worked until it didn't. The relationship ended and I was confused. I thought I was a great partner. They saw differently. 

 ** The pattern didn't fail. It was never true. ** 

 My most troubling pattern is with time: every minute must be productive. When someone suggests slack, my body tightens. Not because they’re wrong - because agreeing dissolves a piece of identity. 

 This is how patterns own you. 

 Suffering is a signal. 
 Notice where you defend instead of adapt. 

 ** Knowing treats the present as a subset of the past; seeing treats the past as a suggestion. ** 

 You either defend your pattern or let it go when reality asks for something else. 

 Right now, what are you defending? 
 ​ ** See it now, if you can. **

#  The Frontier Economy 

 Finding where AI fails is the new expertise 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 29th, 2025 ​ 

 Students once sought jobs through Handshake. 

 Now they're training what replaces those jobs. 

 ​ [ Handshake spent a decade connecting 20 million students to employers. ] Then frontier AI labs discovered what Handshake really had: 500,000 PhDs who could teach machines where they fail. 

 Early reporting indicates these PhDs earn $100-150/hour finding model failures, several times average grad-TA pay. [ The new business line reportedly hit $50 million in four months. ] ​ 

 ** However, this isn't about one company's clever pivot. ** 

 It's the first at-scale transfer of tacit specialist knowledge into continuously learning systems. 
###  The Compression Pattern 

 → Basic labeling started at $5/hour. Mostly automated. 

 → RLHF feedback started at $40/hour. Dropped more than 50% in 18 months. Automating now. 

 → PhD-level fault finding commands $100-150/hour today. 

 Today's fault-finders become tomorrow's eval-writers, next week's automated benchmarks. The expertise ladder extends upward as each rung gets automated away. 

 ** What's Actually Happening ** 

 The feedback loop: Humans find failures → Models learn → New failures emerge at higher abstraction → Repeat. 

 Each cycle compresses decades of expertise into API calls for most routine queries at $20/month. 

 The scarce asset isn't the knowledge itself, it's owning the continuous evaluation loop that turns one-off failures into general capability. 
###  The Real Shift 

 When expert knowledge becomes radically cheaper (not free - compute costs remain massive), fundamentals shift. 

 ** Research accelerates measurably. ** [ Recent controlled studies show AI-assisted researchers producing 10-15% more output. ] The bottleneck shifts from "finding someone who knows" to "formulating questions worth asking." 

 ** Value migrates to the edges. ** Work that models master loses value rapidly. Work at the frontier - finding novel failures, designing evaluation schemas, bearing liability for consequential decisions starts to concentrates all the value. 

 But the meta dynamic is that the pool narrows as it deepens. Today's 500,000 PhDs becomes tomorrow's 50,000 specialists, then 5,000 world experts defining entirely new evaluation frameworks. 

 ** Knowledge becomes abundant. 
 Its complements become precious. ** 

 Edge-finding at scale matters more than finding individual errors. The ability to build evaluation harnesses that systematically probe model boundaries across domains. 

 Institutional permission grows in value. [ Having the credentials, liability coverage, and regulatory approval to deploy AI systems ] in high-stakes domains where lives and billions are at stake. 

 Most critically, [ taste and judgment ] about which of [ infinite possible ] questions actually matter. The constraint is the ability to direct knowledge toward valuable outcomes under real-world constraints. 
###  The Inversion Timeline 

 ** Short term: ** Humans price the long tail of errors that models miss. 

 ** Medium term: ** Synthetic data models handle common failures; humans shift to meta-evaluation, designing the tests that define what intelligence means. 

 ** Long term: ** Humans define what "correct" even means as the frontier advances into uncharted territory. 

 We're not approaching equilibrium. 
 We're accelerating through continuous inversion. 

 ** What This Means ** 

 The economy isn't just changing, it's inverting around a new axis. 

 Knowledge was scarce and expensive, now abundant but subsidized by massive compute costs. Pure execution was everything, now it's table stakes where ground truth exists, premium where it doesn't. 

 Those who build and own the evaluation infrastructure - who can systematically find, categorize, and monetize edge cases will capture disproportionate value. 

 ** The median job transforms rather than disappears, ** becoming the human context layer that machines need to operate in the real world. 

 When knowledge becomes radically cheaper, the margins command an increasing premium. And those margins never stop moving upward. 

 ** The question isn't 'How do I use AI?' but 'What can I evaluate that AI cannot?' ** Start building that detection muscle today. 

 Spend time finding where current AI tools break in your domain. Those failure points are tomorrow's valuable expertise.

#  Case Study #19: Validation Tax 

 How Veeva turned regulatory burden into shared infrastructure 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 28th, 2025 ​ 

 ​ [ Veeva's ] breakthrough wasn't "better software." It was moving validation from a customer project to a vendor product. 

 By 2010–2011, after several years inside pharma accounts, the team saw a recurring pattern: customers spent months preparing for each software change. ** Licenses were expensive; validation was pricier. ** 

 The industry had normalized the impossible, software that cost more to validate than to buy. 

 ** Incumbent playbook: ** sell licenses, then validation services project. ** Veeva's insight: ** make validation part of the release and ship evidence with the software. 

 Everything else flows from that framebreak. 
###  ** The listening-post wedge ** 

 Veeva entered with a pharma-specific CRM on Salesforce, borrowing credibility in a conservative, security-sensitive industry. 

 Without this [ trust infrastructure ] they couldn't have put Veeva engineers inside commercial teams. The validation insight emerged from that customer work, then expanded on Veeva's own platform (Vault). 

 ** The validation nightmare ** 

 In life sciences, validation isn't paperwork - it's proof. You define intended use, test that the system does it, prove people can use it correctly, lock down change control, and maintain a tamper-proof history. Miss a step? Fail inspection. 

 Fail an inspection? Delay drug approvals worth hundreds of millions. Changes that took days to implement required months to validate. Innovation froze. 

 Most vendors treated this bottleneck as inevitable. 
 Veeva saw it as design opportunity. 
###  ** The architectural answer ** 

 What if validation became infrastructure rather than overhead? 

 To make that real, ** Veeva built Vault around one principle: absorb the shared burden of validation into the product itself. ** 

 Every Vault release ships with Veeva's vendor-side validation (IQ/OQ) and a summary report from its audited quality & compliance program. Customers still verify intended use in their environment (PQ), but the re-project each upgrade used to trigger is gone. 

 ** How this works in practice: ** 

 This moves toward what I call [ operating rails - infrastructure where shared burdens get absorbed by the operator. ] Veeva validates the platform once; all customers inherit that evidence instead of rebuilding it individually. 

 ** This isn't full operating rails - Veeva doesn't make compliance decisions or assume liability for regulatory outcomes ** . But by pooling the validation burden, they transform an individual tax into shared infrastructure. 

 The platform orchestrates the next right step while preserving human judgment. ** Humans focus on judgment, not coordination. ** 

 ** What changed for users: ** 

 → ** New releases: ** from months of binders to streamlined upgrades 
 → ** Approvals: ** from emailed documents to auditable record trails 
 → ** Audits: ** from war rooms to clicking replay on decision trails 

 ** Why this creates durable lock-in ** 

 Customers weren't buying features; they bought freedom from the validation burden. Once the cost of staying current collapses, you ride the vendor's release train. Switching means taking back months of work you just escaped. 

 ** Why incumbents couldn't absorb it ** 

 Legacy vendors were optimized for document-centric installs and services-heavy validation projects. Matching Veeva required converting profitable services into productized capabilities and standing up an audited QMS to deliver vendor-side validation at scale. 

 The technical pieces existed; the economic & architectural shift did not. 
###  ** The NewCo playbook ** ** Absorb the shared burden. ** Take on vendor-side burdens and ship evidence with every release. ** Make compliance programmable. ** Bake audit trails, access controls, and approvals into product architecture. ** Pool the heavy lift. ** One validation effort serves all customers; they confirm intended use in their environment. ** Pre-pave the lanes. ** Block unsafe change in software; reserve exceptions for human judgment. ** Measure adoption speed. ** Time-to-value becomes the advantage when friction disappears. 

 The customer still owns compliance outcomes; the process burden shifts from individual to infrastructure. 

 ** Find your industry's validation tax. Absorb the operator's share. **

#  The 2-Hour Future of Work: Why It Won't Happen 

 AI promises compression but delivers the opposite 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 27th, 2025 ​ 

 The 2-hour learning day isn't science fiction. 
 It's happening in Austin right now. 

 ​ [ Yesterday I heard a fascinating podcast with the CEO of Alpha School. ] Here students master academic content in 2 hours daily - [ scoring in top percentiles ] while spending 75% less time than traditional students. 

 Through AI-personalized lessons, real-time engagement monitoring, and mastery-based progression, they achieve grade-level competence in 20-30 hours instead of 180. 

 Listening to the podcast I couldn't help but see how ** the workplace mirrors this compression. ** [ Mckinsey analysts compress weeks of market research into hours. ] Legal teams surface key findings in days instead of months. [ GitHub Copilot users ship code 55% faster. ] 

 Yet we still measure work in 8-hour increments. 
 The disconnect is growing. 

 I am currently living in this acceleration trap. 

 These new tools have allowed me to research and synthesize large amounts of data, giving me so much more fodder for my writing. Leading me to increase my writing frequency even further. 

 Better synthesis tools helped me evaluate deals quicker, so I took on more opportunities. Each efficiency gain became permission to do more, not less. 

 ** The tools were supposed to create space. 
 Instead, they created urgency. ** 

 Here is what I see happening as the grunt work disappears, expectations rise. Quality bars lift. You're not just faster - you're expected to be better, more comprehensive, more everything. 
###  ** Two Potential Futures: ** 

 → ** Portfolio Careers: ** Knowledge workers [ juggle multiple fractional roles ] , maintaining income through variety rather than duration 

 → ** The Output Ratchet: ** Performance expectations rise until today's 10x becomes tomorrow's baseline - the Korean hagwon effect goes corporate 

 History overwhelmingly favors option 2. 

 The [ Korean hagwon paradox ] perfectly illustrates why. Parents know after-school tutoring until midnight harms their children, yet participation keeps intensifying. Everyone sees the collective insanity. No one can individually defect. 

 ** Coordination failure is what stops this compression from happening. ** If your client expects 8-hour availability but you work 2, you're fired. Team assumptions matter - if your team operates on different time frames, projects collapse. 

 Global competition magnifies this trend, if one country maintains 996 while the other tries 2-hour days, guess who wins. 

 This isn't a technology problem. It's a prisoner's dilemma where defecting (working more) always beats cooperating (working less). The same dynamics created [ investment banking's 100-hour weeks despite decades of efficiency gains. ] ​ 

 ​ [ Countries tried right-to-disconnect laws? ] Already failing. [ Four-day workweeks? ] Pilot programs that never scale. 

 The market doesn't care about work-life balance manifestos. 

 ​ [ ** Liv Boeree calls this the Moloch trap ** ] ** - the mechanism of unhealthy competition. ** Short-term incentives push players to sacrifice their future. AI doesn't free us from Moloch. It gives Moloch better tools. ​ 

 ** The result: we'll use AI's efficiency to do more, not less. Not because we're foolish, but because the system demands it. ** 

 Alpha School only works because it exists outside the traditional system. They didn't reform education - they built a parallel structure with different incentives. The same logic applies to work. Adding AI to current models won't create 2-hour workdays. It'll create 8-hour days with 40 hours of output. 

 History says we'll use compression to do more, not less. 

 The real experiment isn't whether AI compresses work. ** It's whether we can design systems that resist the hedonistic treadmill. **

#  Operating Rails: Beyond SaaS & Consulting 

 Decision externalization with bounded liability 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 25th, 2025 ​ 

 Your competitors won’t share anything with each other. But they’ll pay a security operator to make decisions for everyone. Why? 

 They want ** decision externalization with bounded liability ** . 

 For twenty years, we've known two architectures: 

 ** SaaS builds Product Rails. ** Your Slack instance gets smarter with your data, minimal learning from the network. Brilliant tool; local learning. 

 ** Consulting builds Human Rails. ** MBB carries patterns and context between clients but information lives in heads and slide decks. Moves at human speed. 

 NewCos can use a third way: 

 ** Operating Rails: ** Every customer's resolution makes every other customer better - automatically. Here's the evolution: 

 ** Stage 1: Pattern sharing (no liability). ** [ GitHub Copilot ] learns from millions of developers, better suggestions, but won't pay if it breaks production. Value: collective learning. 

 ** Stage 2: Bounded risk sharing. ** [ Stripe Radar ] identifies fraud patterns across merchants. Miss one? They'll cover losses up to defined caps in certain programs. Value: partial risk transfer. 

 ** Stage 3: Decision externalization. ** [ CrowdStrike ] decides what to block across thousands of companies. Wrong call? They carry insurance, provide SLAs and capped indemnities. Value: accountable under caps. 

 As trust builds and patterns prove out, liability expands. Today's pattern consolidators become tomorrow's risk absorbers. 

 Not a product. Not a service. 

 Infrastructure where the best move travels and secrets stay home, and a third party shoulders a ** defined slice of downside ** . 
###  ** The Innovation Isn't Just Technical, It's Economic ** 

 Operating Rails work because someone shares bounded downside when they're wrong. Wrong auto-decisions cost the operator, so systems get tail-risk sensitive. 

 Through strong SLAs and narrow, capped warranties for auto-applied decisions, operators transform pattern sharing into measurable risk reduction. 

 Pattern sharing alone isn't new. What's new is operators taking liability within defined boundaries. That changes everything. 

 Companies aren't buying "pattern sharing." They're buying decision externalization with accountability. 

 ** Where Rails Belong (And Don't) ** 

 Rails work where feedback is fast and outcomes are clear: fraud (binary), security (measurable), compliance (auditable). 

 They fail where success is subjective or adversarial. You can't underwrite "good hiring" or "winning strategy." 

 ** Why Companies Pay ** 

 Operating Rails work when three things line up: 

 → ** External enemy: ** fraudsters, hackers, bugs hit everyone 

 → ** Bounded responsibility: ** platform shoulders specific, capped error risk 

 → ** Fast feedback: ** know if patterns work in hours, not quarters 

 When these align, even competitors pay to pool outcomes. The risk-adjusted return becomes clear. 
###  ** The Strategic Sequence ** 

 Build [ trust infrastructure ] before rails, not after. 

 Stripe processed payments before Radar. GitHub had developers before Copilot. CrowdStrike earned contracts before pattern pooling. 

 ** Solve immediate pain → Earn permission → Discover patterns → Build rails → Offer bounded risk transfer → Earn the layer ** 

 This mirrors how insurance evolved: start with simple, bounded risks (fire), then expand to more complex ones (liability) as data and capital accumulate. Rails become insurance-like operational assurance. 

 ** Finding Your Rail ** 

 Ask: What problem is bigger than my customers' competition with each other? 

 Then ask: Can we credibly shoulder bounded downside through caps, carve-outs, and fast rollback? 

 Start where both answers are yes. 

 The moat is the validated dataset + underwriting capacity ** . ** 

 Code can be copied. Underwriting, trust, and history can't. 

 ** The Long Game ** 

 Today's rails handle deterministic problems with clear liability. Each successfully covered miss builds trust reservoirs and expands risk capacity. 

 Fraud rails earn permission to handle payments tomorrow. Security rails graduate into compliance guarantees. 

 The trust compounds. 
 The liability capacity expands. 
 The moat deepens. 

 ** The Question That Matters ** 

 Don't ask: "How do I build better features?" 

 Ask: ** "What risk would my entire industry pay to transfer to someone with better pattern data and visible brakes?" ** 

 Find that risk. Build the rails. 
 Take bounded responsibility when you're wrong. 

 The next decade's monopolies won't only own products or relationships. They'll own the infrastructure where shared problems become moats.

## ServiceNow's Pattern Paradox

#  ServiceNow's Pattern Paradox 

 Moving from selling workflows to underwriting outcomes 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 26th, 2025 ​ 

 Twenty years ago, enterprise workflows were chaos. Tickets lost in email. Requests buried in spreadsheets. 

 ** ServiceNow's fix: ** one workflow engine for everything - IT tickets, HR requests, security approvals. 

 The result became the standard across the Fortune 500. 

 ** Q2 FY25 scorecard: ** Subscription revenue: $3.11B (+22% YoY) Current RPO: $10.92B (+24%) 89 deals over $1M in net-new ACV 528 customers at $5M+ ACV Non-GAAP operating margin: 29.5% Implied NRR: >120% in core base 

 These numbers show an engine that continues to compound beautifully. To keep compounding, ServiceNow must graduate from selling workflows to operating decisions. 

 The CEO Bill McDermott calls it becoming the "control tower for agentic AI." That's not AI keyword stuffing. It's an early admission that selling modules and SKU uplifts won't be enough for the next decade. 
###  ** Standardization, not just lock-in ** 

 CIOs don't call it a prison. They call it governance. After a decade of decentralized SaaS buying created chaos, they wanted a standard platform to control cost, manage risk, and create one source of operational truth. 

 High switching cost is the feature they paid for. 

 To reach this vision, the company relied heavily on SIs to deliver. They build accelerators and industry solutions on ServiceNow, feeding patterns back into product teams. That feedback loop makes the platform stickier and smarter. 

 ** Product Rails that work. Operating Rails that matter. ** 

 ServiceNow perfected Product Rails. One platform, many workflows, high renewal rates. The machine prints money. 

 But McDermott's vision of Operating Rails requires two new ingredients: learning that compounds across customers and bounded liability for automated decisions. 

 The company that built [ CMDB - the Configuration Management Database ] that maps every IT asset and relationship, understands the value of structured data. Their dataset knows which changes break production, which teams resolve issues fastest, which configurations create vulnerabilities. 

 Generic AI can't replicate that institutional memory - but ServiceNow needs to turn this data advantage into accountable automation. 

 Today's model remains mixed. Sales incentives favor large, multi-year licenses. Contracts disclaim operational risk. Implementations run through global SIs who integrate the stack and curate the playbooks. 
###  ** Where the model strains ** 

 Three forces threaten the current architecture: 

 ** * Services dependency. * ** ** ** Partners see cross-client patterns first. They refine playbooks across dozens of customers while ServiceNow sees tenant-level telemetry. Unless ServiceNow pulls more of that learning inside, partners capture most operational intelligence. 

 ** * The bundle. * ** ** ** Microsoft embeds automation into Teams and Office. The suite turns "good enough" into a budget conversation. The bundle pressures the mid-market and non-regulated functions. 

 ** * Vertical squeeze. * ** ** ** Specialists like Veeva and Guidewire go deeper on high-value workflows. They don't need the whole market - only the most profitable lanes that ServiceNow can't defend with generic workflows. 

 ** The agent at the surface ** 

 ServiceNow doesn't own the primary surfaces where people work. Increasingly, Microsoft's agents will orchestrate everyone's APIs - including ServiceNow's. Users may never open ServiceNow directly. 

 To avoid becoming a headless API endpoint, ServiceNow's agents must be the most reliable and accountable - or win the default position inside Microsoft's surfaces. 
###  ** The path forward ** 

 ServiceNow has the [ trust infrastructure ] , the CMDB moat, and the balance sheet to evolve from Product Rails to Operating Rails. 

 The threats are real because the entire architecture of enterprise software is shifting. 

 Shift AI pricing toward delivered outcomes rather than feature uplifts. Move incentives toward time-to-value and consumption, not just ACV. 

 Go deeper on non-competitive operational plumbing where standardization is welcomed, and let partners own the bespoke logic built on top. 

 McDermott understands the landscape is changing - his repeated "control tower" language proves it. The question is whether ServiceNow will sacrifice today's beautiful economics to own the learning loop and tie automation to service credits. 

 The choice facing major SaaS providers: ** become the underwriting layer for enterprise operations, or watch as you're reduced to expensive plumbing. **

#  Taste Can't Be Trained 

 Obsession beats discipline 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 23rd, 2025 ​ 

 Everyone wants taste. Few commit to obsession. 

 That's the difference. 

 My post on [ when everyone can build everything ] argued taste becomes everything when tools are infinite. That curation beats creation. That editorial judgment is your moat. 

 But I left out an uncomfortable truth. 

 The 10,000-hour rule, deliberate practice, courses on cultivating discernment are all prescriptions that promised taste. 

 Put in the reps, get the results. Simple transaction. 

 But look around. ** How many people logged their 10,000 hours and remain mediocre? ** How many followed every framework yet failed to produce meaningful work? 

 Most of us believe we can add taste like another skill for our toolkit. We want the hack, the step-by-step guide. 

 Early on in my career I spent years studying design, emulating patterns, refining my eye. My taste in UI design became a key strength. Later, I prescribed the same path to junior designers. 

 ** They put in the hours. Followed the framework. 
 Yet, most never developed taste. ** 

 Looking back, I see the convenient lie I told myself: it was all deliberate practice. That's revisionist history. I wasn't practicing - I was obsessed. The hours weren't discipline. They were obsession. 

 My junior designers were practicing. I was consumed. 

 Like the entrepreneur who can't stop thinking about their market. Or the investor who sees patterns in annual reports. ** Truth doesn’t emerge from frameworks, it reveals itself through immersion. ** 

 That's the difference. 

 We fall for the mantra that discipline gets you everything you want. Being obsessed is about having your brain hijacked. When the pursuit burns so deep, alternatives don't get rejected. They disappear. 

 ** This isn't burnout. Burnout comes from forcing yourself. Obsession feels like breathing - you do it without thinking, without choosing. ** 

 Taste without obsession stays shallow - learned patterns that collapse under pressure. When you are obsessed, it runs deep. 

 ** The dabbler asks: "How do I develop better taste?" ** 

 The obsessed never ask. They're drowning in their work. By the time they surface, taste has already emerged. 

 Stop trying to cultivate discernment. 
 Stop collecting frameworks. 

 Find the one thing that won't let you go. Give yourself to it completely. 

 The rest happens on its own. 

 I know what you're thinking. 

 ** "But I don't have an obsession. Nothing has claimed me." ** 

 Maybe. Or maybe you're looking for the wrong thing. 

 Obsession doesn't announce itself. It shows up as the thing you read about when you should be sleeping. The problem you can't stop thinking about in the shower. The work you do for free because not doing it feels worse. 

 It's rarely glamorous. The entrepreneur obsessed with inventory management. The designer who can't stop fixing kerning. The analyst who sees patterns in spreadsheets others find mind-numbing. 

 ** You might already be obsessed. 
 You just expected it to feel different. ** 

 Or you might be protecting yourself from it. Because ** obsession is terrifying ** - it removes your optionality, kills your backup plans, makes you vulnerable to failure in a way dabbling never does. 

 The question isn't "what am I obsessed with?" 

 It's "what am I avoiding being obsessed with?" 

 Taste can't be trained. It can only be claimed by the thing that refuses to let you go.

#  When Everyone Can Build Everything 

 The final leverage shift from production to selection 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 22nd, 2025 ​ 

 Most are underestimating the implications of what happens when the cost of creation goes to zero. 

 Marginal cost is the expense of producing one additional unit of anything. For decades, this created natural scarcity. Building the second website, writing the second article, designing the second logo always cost more. 

 AI breaks this rule entirely. 

 Train once, use infinitely. Build once, scale endlessly. Creating the millionth piece of content costs the same as the first. 

 ** When marginal cost approaches zero, the entire game changes. ** 

 Everyone gets access to infinite production capability. The bottleneck shifts from "can we afford to make this?" to "what's worth making?" 

 This creates a new economic divide. Not between those who have resources and those who don't, but between those who can curate infinite possibility and those who consume whatever algorithms surface. 

 ** Your editorial lens becomes your competitive moat ** - not just in creative fields, but in investing, entrepreneurship, strategy, any domain where choices matter more than execution. The key question: When anyone can build anything, how do you stand out? 
###  ** When Everyone Can Build Everything ** 

 The implications extend far beyond content creation. 

 Tools democratize access; judgment compounds advantage. Anyone can launch a Shopify store for $29/month, but knowing which products to sell and how to structure operations separates success from failure. 

 This pattern will repeat across all streams of work. 

 Writing tools let anyone publish content, but knowing what to say and how to say it requires developed taste. Investment platforms let anyone buy stocks, but knowing what deserves capital separates amateurs from professionals. 

 This shift reveals a new kind of power structure. 

 ** The Algorithm Divide ** 

 While AI democratized the tools, it concentrated the power. 

 When anyone can build anything, those who decide what gets built control everything. Which problems deserve solving, which opportunities deserve capital, which ideas deserve attention. 
###  ** The Taste Advantage ** 

 Here's how this plays out in practice. [ In 2012, a $4,500 video beat million-dollar ad campaigns. ] ​ 

 Same tools, different taste. 

 Michael Dubin didn't have better video equipment than Gillette. He didn't have a bigger marketing budget. His advantage was editorial judgment - knowing exactly what messaging would cut through the noise and resonate with frustrated customers. 

 While Gillette spent millions on polished commercials featuring athletes and premium imagery, Dubin understood that people were tired of overpriced razors and complicated purchasing. His taste and direct messaging beat their massive resources. 

 When everyone has access to the same tools, success flows to those who develop superior discerning ability about what deserves attention. 

 ** The Editorial Advantage ** 

 Those with sensitivity to what works and why create disproportionate value. As Rick Rubin describes in The Creative Act, this sensitivity emerges from deep immersion in one domain. Those who see patterns others miss aren't trying harder - they're looking from a different depth. 

 ** Most drift, accepting whatever algorithms surface. ** Others develop their lens through relentless immersion - putting things out there because they can't not create, seeing patterns because they can't look away. 

 The question isn't whether you can access the tools - it's whether you can direct them toward something that matters. 

 ** When everyone can build everything for free, curation becomes more valuable than creation. ** 

 History won’t remember the abundance of tools. 
 It will remember the scarcity of taste.

#  Case Study #18: Trust Arbitrage 

 How Anduril deleted what Pentagon incumbents couldn't 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 21st, 2025 ​ 

 The Pentagon, 2017. The U.S. defense industrial base was stagnant, built to win the Cold War. 

 Legacy prime contractors operated on cost-plus contracts, a model that incentivized 10-year timelines and billion-dollar overruns. [ Lockheed's F-35 program: 17 years in development, $1.7 trillion lifecycle cost ] . [ Boeing's KC-46 tanker: 8 years late, $5 billion in overruns ] ​ 

 The bottleneck wasn't technology. [ It was the trust architecture. ] The DoD trusted process over performance. 

 ** Anduril's founders saw an arbitrage opportunity: ** the Pentagon's procurement model was designed for a low [ clockspeed world ] . 

 The team that came together reads like a carefully orchestrated dream team. [ ** Palmer Luckey ** was the wild card genius ] who'd built the future from outside the system, solving key virtual reality problems at [ Oculus  before selling to Facebook for $2 billion ] . 

 ​ [ ** Trae Stephens ** was the inside man ] . A Founders Fund partner who'd [ served on Trump's Defense transition team ] , he'd spent years at Palantir learning how to sell complex software to skeptical government buyers. 

 ​ [ ** Brian Schimpf ** was the execution engine ] . Nearly a decade at Palantir, building software that intelligence agencies actually used, rising from a Forward Deployed Engineer to Director of Engineering. 

 ** Together, they assembled the credibility to get into decision rooms. ** 

 While competitors optimized their government relations teams, Anduril removed the need for them. They didn't promise a future system; they showed up with a working one funded by their own capital. 

 Legacy primes move in 5 to 10 years. 
 Anduril ships in 5 to 10 months. 
 Everyone credits the tech. 
 The real disruption was the trust model, built for velocity. 
###  ** The Moat Isn't Tech. It's the Trust Model. ** 

 Anduril's competitive advantage isn't what they built. It's what they removed: cost-plus contracts that reward delays, requirements cycles that kill urgency, integration nightmares that fragment systems, and R&D processes that stretch for decades. 

 Competitors can't copy this without gutting their own operating assumptions. The switching costs aren't technical. They're existential. 

 The question is: how do you delete what incumbents can't live without? 

 ** The traditional defense sale is a marathon of milestones: ** Capability gap identified Requirements defined in the Joint Capabilities Integration & Development System (JCIDS) Technology development contract awarded Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 

 Each milestone takes years. Each is a trust hurdle built on paper and projections. 

 Anduril's model creates a closed loop built on proof. 

 They didn't target a massive DoD program first. They found a customer with an urgent, tangible problem: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 

 They deployed their [ Sentry Tower on a private Texas ranch ] and proved it worked, helping agents make 55 arrests and seize 982 lbs of contraband in just 10 weeks. 

 ** They didn't sell a proposal; they demonstrated an outcome. ** 

 The playbook worked. First border security, then Marine bases, then the ultimate validation: when Microsoft stumbled on the Army's $22 billion IVAS combat goggle program, the [ Pentagon handed it to Anduril ] . 

 ** Proof had beaten pedigree. ** 

 Each hardware sale embeds more software, creating an expanding web of dependence. The Sentry Towers became a "Trojan horse" for their true product: [ the Lattice software OS ] . 

 This wasn't just about defense. Every industry has trust models waiting to be arbitraged. 
###  ** Final Principle: Don't Optimize the Old Trust Model. Replace It. ** 

 All industries hide behind process when performance fails. 
 ​ 
 ​ ** Every NewCo has a choice: ** inherit that process, or replace it with outcomes. 
 ​ 
 The companies that win won’t just move faster. ** They’ll re-architect trust itself - not as a promise, but as a product. ** ​ 
 ​ 
 Take the beach. 
 Earn the fleet. 
 Redraw the map.

## Who Will Own Intelligence?

#  Who Will Own Intelligence? 

 The infrastructure bet to control how you think 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 20th, 2025 ​ 

 In 1997, a WorldCom engineer named Tom Stluka created a spreadsheet that would trigger one of the largest infrastructure buildouts in history. 

 Using Excel, he modeled a "best-case scenario" [ where internet traffic would double every 100 days ] . His CEO, Kevin Boyne, loved the projections and encouraged him to make them even more aggressive. ​ [ As Stluka later admitted ] : "I just assigned variables for those various parameters, and then said we can set those variables to whatever we think is appropriate." 

 That single spreadsheet became gospel. 

 WorldCom's Bernie Ebbers echoed the forecast. AT&T's new CEO adopted it. The [ "doubling meme" ] spread through the telecommunications industry, justifying a cumulative [ investment well over $500 billion ] , including $800 billion in M&A in 1999. 

 The projections weren't wrong - we did need all that fiber. 

 But the timeline was catastrophically off. Internet traffic was actually [ doubling once per year ] , not every 100 days. Within years, scores of major telecom players went bankrupt, and [ 97% of installed fiber cables sat unused. ] ​ 

 ** Twenty-five years later, the spreadsheet is back. ** 

 But this time, it's written in a different language. 

 Data center construction has tripled since 2021, reaching $40 billion annualized. [ Paul Krugman warns these facilities could consume up to 12% of US electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% today ] . 

 Meanwhile, the office construction pipeline has collapsed 75% in square footage since 2020. ​ 

 We're trading infrastructure that once housed hundreds of thousands for infrastructure that aims to render most of those jobs irrelevant. 

 But here's the crucial difference: unlike the 1990s telecom startups burning venture capital, today's infrastructure bet is funded by the most profitable corporations in history. 

 → [ Microsoft guided $30 billion in quarterly capex ] ​ 
 → [ Meta projects $64-72 billion for 2025 ] ​ 
 → [ Amazon's capex will exceed $100 billion this year ] ​ 

 They're not betting the company. 
 They're using excess cash to buy cognitive control. 

 ** This changes everything about the infrastructure bet's risk profile. ** 

 ​ [ WorldCom and Global Crossing went bankrupt ] because they had no revenue while building networks for future demand. 

 Today's data center builders are profitable today while building for tomorrow's possibilities. They can survive scaling law plateaus, AI disappointments, even prolonged infrastructure underutilization. 

 They're not building compute capacity. 
 They're buying [ cognitive control ] . 

 ** This isn't only about AI adoption - it's about rearchitecting the system. ** 

 The companies spending $40 billion every quarter aren't trying to do the same work faster. They're rebuilding how cognitive work gets structured, who controls it, and how value flows through it. 

 The infrastructure pivot signals something deeper: we're not automating tasks, we're architecting a new system where intelligence is abundant instead of scarce. 

 ** The real monopoly in this world isn't compute - ** [ ** it's standards ** ] ** . ** 

 Fiber overbuild turned bandwidth into a commodity. 
 Cognitive overbuild won't. 

 Unlike fiber, cognition isn't measured in gigabits. It's measured in defaults. Whoever defines the "standard" way to think - the default copilot, the standard productivity suite, the universal API for intelligence - positions to set the rent forever. 

 Of course, open-source models like Meta's Llama represent a direct challenge to this control. But even open-source challengers risk becoming tenants in the very data centers they hoped to bypass. 

 ** The beauty of today's bet is it hedges most outcomes ** - one key concern hyperscalers face are the rapid depreciation cycles and regulatory pressure that could test the model if AI demand lags. 

 ** → AI delivers? ** They own the pipes powering cognitive abundance 
 ​ ** → AI plateaus? ** Knowledge workers still need the tools anyway 
 ​ ** → AI disappoints? ** They've built whatever cognitive augmentation comes next 

 Unlike fiber cables that became commoditized utilities, cognitive infrastructure aims to create durable platform dependencies which could be contested but difficult to escape. 

 Every knowledge worker needing AI tools to meet rising productivity expectations becomes a tenant in Microsoft's, Google's, or Meta's cognitive real estate. 

 The bet assumes today's GPU-heavy paradigm remains dominant. History suggests otherwise: mainframe overbuilds didn't see the PC revolution coming. 

 ** The real transformation won't be human vs. AI. ** 

 It's the potential creation of cognitive landlords. 

 These aren't simply power-hungry computers - they're cognitive rental properties. Everyone will gain amazing capabilities but they will be renting them from a handful of platform owners. 

 We're not working towards automating work. We're potentially centralizing control over the tools of intelligence itself. 

 The 1990s showed us timelines can be wrong. 

 This time, the question isn't when the buildout pays off - it's who owns intelligence when it does.

#  CACI's Sequence Strategy 

 Infrastructure before innovation in practice 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 19th, 2025 ​ 

 The billable model is cracking from two sides: efficiency cuts it from above, automation from below. 

 Most firms are responding predictably: launching digital practices, add AI buzzwords to every project, repackaging services as "solutions." 

 It buys headlines, not durability. 

 I was searching for a firm who is successfully pulling off what a commenter called RefreshCo. The painful process of reinventing a LegacyCo and moving from human to technology leverage. 

 I came across [ CACI International ] who appears to be navigating this shift better than most. For 54 years, they were another government contractor: predictable contracts, billable hours, thin margins. Then in 2016, leadership made the intentional decision to start making the shift. 

 ** They built trust first. Technology second. ** ​ 
 ​ 
 The sequence mattered more than the strategy. 

 ** The numbers are showing a payoff: ** 
 → ** FY25 Revenue: ** $8.6B, up 13% 
 → ** Technology Mix: ** 55% of revenue, growing at 16.5% 
 → ** Organic Growth: ** ~10% YoY 
 → ** Backlog: ** $31.4B, ~4 years of visibility 
 → ** Free Cash Flow: ** Executive incentives tied to cash flow targets ​ 

 Those numbers didn't happen by accident. While competitors struggled with the same pressures, CACI built something different. This turned out to be a great story about intentional architecture. 
###  CACI’s transformation happened in three phases: 

 ** Step 1: Extending the rails (2016) ** ​ 
 The first move was about ** distribution and credibility. ** [ CACI spent $550M to acquire L-3 National Security Solutions ] . A classic services business. On the surface, nothing changed. But strategically, this gave them ** prime positions on sensitive government contracts and the security clearances that make or break access. ** 

 This wasn't about buying growth. They bought [ ** trust infrastructure and cover ** ] ** ** giving them the ability to rewire the business without losing customers. 

 ** Step 2: Put new trains on the rails (2019) ** ​ 
 With distribution secure, they started layering in ** proprietary technology ** . Instead of chasing new markets, they went deeper into existing areas of expertise: secure communications, signals intelligence, electronic warfare. 

 ** The key was fit ** : these technologies could be sold to the same buyers, for the same missions, using the same contracts. No new go-to-market complexity. Each dollar of sales effort carried further. 

 ** Step 3: Hardwire cash discipline (2016–today) ** ​ 
 All of this required patience from investors used to steady services margins. CACI bought that patience by making ** free cash flow the scoreboard. ** From the start, they told markets FCF per share was the metric that mattered. By 2025, half of executive long-term incentives were tied to three-year FCF targets. 

 This turned financial discipline into governance the constraint that made the pivot credible. 
###  ** Three principles emerge from CACI's transformation: ** 

 ** The first lesson: ** ** build the rails before you run the train. 
 ​ ** Trust and distribution come first because credibility buys time. CACI didn't push unproven tech into skeptical buyers. They bought incumbency and clearances, ensuring new products had a ready-made path to market. 

 ** The second insight: deepen existing lanes before adding new ones. ** Technology should amplify what you already deliver, not distract from it. [ Instead of chasing adjacencies ] , CACI put innovation directly into their existing contracts and missions, doubling the efficiency of each sales motion. 
 ​ 
 Any firm trying to pivot from people to product needs to buy itself credibility and distribution before asking customers to trust something new. 

 ** The final principle: anchor to cash discipline. ** 
 Cash discipline isn't an outcome, it's the constraint that will keep the pivot credible. By tying executive incentives to multi-year free cash flow, CACI showed both investors and employees that discipline wasn't optional. It was the architecture. 
###  ** The Broader Implication ** 

 Every knowledge firm faces identical pressure. Fewer hours. Less expertise. Compressed margins. 
 ​ 
 The question isn't whether these forces will reshape the industry. It's whether firms can realign their models to capture value in the new environment. 

 CACI shows that ** success comes not from technology alone, but from architecture: ** infrastructure before innovation, depth before breadth, cash discipline before growth theater. 

 Most firms fail not for lack of vision, but because they get the order wrong. CACI shows that in services-to-tech pivots, getting the sequence correct isn't an execution detail it * is * the strategy.

## Trust Infrastructure as Competitive Advantage

#  Trust Infrastructure as Competitive Advantage 

 The layer most NewCos ignore 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 18th, 2025 ​ 

 Superior technology usually loses to trust deficits. 

 The NewCos who win understand this deeply. 
###  ** Coverage vs Velocity ** 

 LegacyCos provide coverage - decades of embedded relationships, compliance infrastructure, and institutional safety. 

 NewCos provide velocity - direct paths to outcomes without legacy constraints. 

 Enterprise buyers increasingly have bigger demands: "Will this deliver outcomes fast?" and "Can I justify this choice?" 

 LegacyCos excel at the second. NewCos must excel at both. 

 The solution isn't copying LegacyCo's relationship playbook. It's building trust infrastructure [ optimized for a high clockspeed world ] . 

 ** The Trust Ceiling ** 

 Trust deficits create a velocity ceiling regardless of technology quality. This is structural, not situational. 

 Your product can solve problems 10x faster, but if buyers don't trust your ability to deliver, speed becomes irrelevant. 

 LegacyCos accumulated trust through institutional presence over decades. NewCos must engineer trust through domain expertise and proven outcomes - without the institutional baggage that slows everything down. 

 The NewCo advantage: you understand how enterprise systems work, but you're not constrained by legacy processes that add months to every decision. 
###  ** The NewCo Playbook: Wedge and Expand ** 

 Today's mega-deals are fragmenting into smaller, milestone and outcome driven projects. This creates opportunities that LegacyCos are too expensive and slow to pursue effectively. 

 Your strategy isn't to compete on massive transformations. It's to win wedges and expand from positions of strength. 

 ** Domain Expert Credibility ** 

 Hire thought leaders and domain experts who understand enterprise needs but aren't tied to legacy delivery models. 

 These aren't former LegacyCo talent running old playbooks. They are experts who know what buyers need and how to deliver it faster than institutional approaches. 

 You're importing domain knowledge, not institutional constraints. 

 ** Champion-Led Wedge Entry ** 

 Embed with operational teams before procurement gets involved. Find the specific pain points where speed matters more than coverage. 

 Example: A multinational wants to transform their IT infrastructure. LegacyCo proposes an end-to-end overhaul. But the transformation breaks into specific components - data modeling, business intelligence, system integrations. You target one wedge: implementing a Palantir-based solution for their data management needs. 

 Fast, focused, provable results. 

 Champions help you identify these opportunities where LegacyCo solutions are overkill - too slow, too expensive, too complex for the actual problem. 

 Your go-to-market becomes: solve this specific problem faster than anyone else, then expand from proven results. 

 ** The Speed Advantage ** 

 LegacyCos take 12 months to implement because they're carrying decades of institutional process. You take 3 months because you're purpose-built for the outcome. 

 This speed differential compounds: Faster implementation → faster results → stronger references Wedge wins → adjacent problems → organic expansion Proven outcomes → higher trust → shortened sales cycles 

 ** The Wrong Way ** 

 Some NewCos copy LegacyCo infrastructure: armies of consultants, extensive alliances and extensive approval layers. 

 This destroys your velocity advantage. You end up with LegacyCo trust-building timelines without LegacyCo institutional credibility. Worse, you've imported the very constraints that slow traditional approaches. 

 Trust infrastructure for NewCos means domain expertise without institutional baggage, not institutional processes without institutional credibility. 

 ** Readiness Test ** 

 Before entering any market, answer these key questions: Do you have domain experts who'll publicly endorse your approach? Can you name three specific wedges where your speed beats their coverage? Do you have proof points of 3x faster outcomes than traditional approaches? 

 If yes, you have trust infrastructure built for velocity. If no, you're just another vendor. 

 ** The Compounding Model ** 

 Without trust infrastructure, superior technology gets trapped in endless proof-of-concept cycles. Speed advantages get neutralized by credibility gaps. 

 The difference compounds because trust infrastructure accelerates everything - sales cycles, implementation, expansion, and pricing power. 
###  ** The Choice ** 

 Enterprise buyers increasingly prefer fast wins over comprehensive coverage. You can build trust infrastructure optimized for velocity, or watch superior technology stall in trust deficit. 

 In enterprise markets: speed without trust stalls; trust without speed stagnates. 

 The network rewards companies that understand both realities.

#  The Masks We Can't Remove 

 Why transformation feels like betrayal 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 16th, 2025 ​ 

 Every transformation requires a death. 

 The gap between who you were and who you need to become. 

 You spent decades building expertise. The world shifted. Now you must change too. The pain you feel isn't about losing the work - it's about ** losing the identity you built upon it. ** 

 The consultant whose entire advisory model collapsed. The analyst whose expert knowledge became commoditized. The founder whose industry disappeared overnight. 

 You weren't attached to the work. You were attached to being the person who did the work. 

 ** When that identity dies, letting go feels like betrayal. ** 

 I see this across my entire portfolio. The founder clinging to a business model that generates decent revenue but can't scale past $XM ARR. The engineer who refuses to adopt new frameworks because they've mastered the old ones, even though it's slowing down the entire team. 

 We call it "resistance to change." [ It's actually attachment to an identity that no longer serves you. ] ​ 

 ** This is the human condition we never acknowledge: ** [ ** We are not our roles, but we live as if we are. ** ] ​ 

 Every identity we build is temporary. Every story we tell about ourselves will eventually become irrelevant. The consultant, the founder, the expert - these are masks we wear for transactions. 

 The grief isn't about losing what we do. It's about discovering who we are when the mask comes off. 

 ** Here's what we don't want to admit: ** your expertise was never yours. Your role was never yours. Your company was never yours. 

 They were transactions. You gave time, effort, intelligence. You received salary, status, purpose. Now the transaction is complete. 

 ** The pain comes from believing the transaction was permanent. ** From building an identity around something that was always temporary. 

 When my ventures failed, I couldn't tell people the truth. It wasn't about the money or time - it was about the identity collapse. I was nobody special. Just another founder who'd failed. 

 The numbness wasn't about the business dying. It was about not knowing who I was without the story I'd been telling myself. 

 ** The attachment to being a specific someone keeps you from becoming anyone else. ** 

 You have two choices: defend who you were or discover who you might become. 

 ​ [ Most people choose the first. They spend years protecting an identity that no longer fits while the world moves past them. ] ​ 

 The brave ones choose the second. 
 They let the old self die completely and see what emerges.

#  Building While Burning 

 Why chaos creates our greatest achievements 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 17th, 2025 ​ 

 ** We don't build despite the fire. ** ​ 
 ​ ** We build because of it. ** 

 Throughout history, when old systems crumbled, survivors didn't wait for stability. They used the chaos to spark humanity's greatest leaps - the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, the digital age. 

 These weren't exceptions. It's a pattern. 

 The mistake we make is treating chaos as an anomaly, when it is a constant. ** The world is always on fire ** ** - you just notice when the flames are closer. ** 

 The problem isn't the fire. It's our craving for safety, that waits for the "right moment." [ That craving is the prison ] . 

 Today's most valuable companies rise precisely because legacy systems are breaking around them. 

 What we call "thriving in chaos" isn't about grit or hustle. It's what happens when you abandon the self that fears loss. When we transcend our self limiting beliefs, we stop waiting for better conditions and simply do the thing. 

 Disruption doesn't create growth environments. It strips away illusions, forcing you to build from what matters. 

 The fire never stops burning. The only question is whether you'll use it as fuel or let it consume your courage to begin. 

 ** Reflection for the week: What illusion of safety is keeping you from building what the world is already demanding? **

#  The $200K Part-Time Job Economy 

 Most knowledge work is already fractional - we just pretend it isn't 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 15th, 2025 ​ 

 Dave makes $160K as a software engineer. He does 0-10 hours of deep work per week. The rest is TikTok and mindless vibe coding. 

 Sarah earns $120K as a marketing lead. Her typical week: one internal memo, sometimes writing out reports and telling her boomer clients that "being cringe is cool." 

 Tom pulls $175K as a Big 4 consultant. He spends his day copying AI responses from his phone to his work laptop and deciding which sushi roll to order for lunch. 

 These are fictional profiles based on a popular social media trend of ‘day in the life’ posts from top graduates at prestigious companies. 
 ​ 
 They represent the hidden reality of knowledge work: ** most "full-time" jobs are already part-time. ** 

 This reality has created an underground economy. [ Reddit’s r/overemployed ] community with 509,000 [ members shares strategies ] for working multiple jobs simultaneously. 

 ** This is fraud. ** When you violate exclusivity contracts and deceive multiple employers, that's not arbitrage - it's contract violation with real legal consequences. 

 But the fact that it's even possible reveals something fundamental about how we structure work. 

 ** When someone successfully manages five jobs simultaneously, they're not superhuman. ** They're exposing that each "full-time" role requires maybe 10-15 hours of actual work per week, padded with meetings, coordination, and corporate theater. 
###  ** The economics don't add up: ** 

 Companies pay $100K-$300K salaries for work that genuinely requires 10-20 hours weekly. ** Employees will defend this: "If I can do my job efficiently in 10 hours, that's my skill." ** 

 Fair point for individual performance. 

 But the systemic picture is different. ** Companies aren't simply paying for task completion ** - they're paying for availability, risk mitigation, mentorship, institutional knowledge, and long-term innovation that requires sustained engagement. 

 Dave gets paid to prevent disasters and occasionally guide interns. Sarah gets paid to avoid cultural landmines and provide ongoing insights. Tom gets paid to navigate complex client relationships and build institutional knowledge. 

 The premium is for insurance and ecosystem value, not just deliverables. 

 Here’s where it gets complicated. Companies extract commitment without reciprocating - what I called [ ‘the power tax’ in my AT&T post earlier this week ] . As their CEO admitted, companies have ‘consciously shifted away from loyalty.’ 

 When employees realize this mismatch, they start calculating their own risk hedges. 

 The overemployed aren't just stealing time - they are responding to a broken employment model where both sides are optimizing for self-protection rather than mutual value creation. 

 ** AI accelerates this collision. ** 

 Tom already uses Claude for everything. Dave could automate most debugging. As AI handles coordination and administrative overhead, the gap between full-time salaries and actual work requirements becomes impossible to ignore. 
###  ** Two paths forward: ** 

 ** Path 1: ** Tighten surveillance and controls. Monitor for fraud while maintaining the fiction that 40-hour presence equals 40 hours of value. Fight the symptoms while ignoring the systemic mismatch. 

 ** Path 2: ** Redesign employment around actual value creation. Price work with greater intention. Build roles that require sustained human engagement: strategic thinking, relationship building, innovation, mentorship. 

 The fraud exposes what we already knew but wouldn't admit: ** most knowledge work is project-based outcomes wrapped in time-based packaging. ** 

 Companies that acknowledge this reality first will build more efficient models. Those that don't will keep paying $200K for padded work while underground markets flourish. 

 ** The overemployed are committing fraud. But they're also revealing that our employment models are fundamentally misaligned with how knowledge work actually happens. ** 

 The question now is whether we have the courage to rebuild employment structures that match reality?

#  Case Study #17: Compounding Machine 

 How one 'stupid' idea built a €281B monopoly 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 14th, 2025 ​ 

 Nikon called it stupid. The "stupid" idea created a €281B monopoly. 

 In 1984, Dutch electronics giant Philips did something most LegacyCos never do: it admitted defeat. 

 Buried inside its sprawling bureaucracy was a project to build machines that print circuits on silicon. Capital-intensive, high-risk, moving at the speed of committees. 

 ** Philips knew its own architecture was killing the project. ** 

 So they cut it loose. 

 The spinoff, ASML, wasn't born into glory. It was exiled to a leaky shed with a machine so flawed its hydraulic system sprayed oil mist throughout ultra-clean factories. 

 By 1988, the co-founding partner had bailed. The cash was gone. 

 In a Philips boardroom, ASML was set to be sunset. But one board member, [ Henk Bodt, made a final bet. ] ​ 

 With one last chance, ASML didn't have the luxury of strategy. It had only mission: ** make this one machine work, or die. ** 

 This decision didn't save ASML. It forged its purpose. 

 That purpose had one principle: focus or die. 
##  Own the Negative Space 

 While ASML fought for survival, Japanese rivals Nikon and Canon built empires. Diversified conglomerates. Vertically integrated across every component. 

 But ASML's desperation became its advantage. 

 ASML did the opposite. It couldn't afford an empire. It had to build a machine. 

 ** The critical decision: refuse to build optics internally. ** Partner exclusively with German specialist Carl Zeiss instead. The relationship became symbiotic; less vendor, more extension of ASML itself. 

 While rivals managed internal divisions, ASML managed one perfect partnership. They didn't own the asset. They owned the relationship, infinitely harder to copy. 

 But partnerships alone weren't enough. ASML needed infrastructure. 
##  The Compounding Begins 

 ASML built their machine on two engines. ** First, the technical rails: ** [ ** TWINSCAN architecture ** ] that doubled throughput while competitors optimized old designs. Every innovation became an upgrade, not a new product. Rails compound speed. ​ 

 ** Second, the financial flywheel: ** every machine sold became an annuity. Service contracts, upgrades, optimizations. Twenty-five percent recurring revenue that de-risked massive R&D bets. 

 Perfect loop: yesterday's machines fund tomorrow's breakthroughs. 

 With compounding speed and capital secured, ASML made their boldest move. 
##  Weaponize Your Ecosystem 

 By the early 2000s, ASML faced its make-or-break moment. While competitors pursued "obvious" EUV technology, ASML proposed something different: [ immersion lithography ] . Adding water drops to push existing tech beyond limits. 

 ** Nikon's response was swift: "Stupid idea." ** 

 They were catastrophically wrong. ASML's hack delivered a decade of dominance while rivals' EUV programs stalled. 

 But ASML wasn't done. CEO Eric Meurice asked biggest customers [ Intel ] , [ Samsung ] , [ TSMC ] to buy equity stakes in their own supplier. They invested billions to build their own future while locking out every competitor. 

 This wasn't fundraising. It was a masterful stroke of architectural genius. Customers became partners. Ecosystem compounds trust. 

 ** With every element aligned: speed, capital, trust. ASML tackled the impossible. ** 
##  The Machine Delivers 

 With every element compounding in perfect sync, ASML tackled the "technical miracle" that bankrupted rivals: making EUV reality. 

 The solution required controlled violence at microscopic scale. Lasers blast 50,000 molten tin droplets per second into EUV-emitting plasma. Light reflects off mirrors so perfect that if you scaled one to Germany's size, the largest bump would be under one millimeter. 

 ** Two decades and €9 billion later, ASML stood alone. Problem difficulty eliminated everyone else. ** 

 The compounding machine had worked. 

 The story of ASML proves one truth: [ coherence eats capabilities for breakfast. ] ​ 

 Nikon and Canon had superior resources and market leadership. But they managed complexity. ASML compounded focus. 

 Competitors weren't wrong about EUV being the future. Their mistake was lacking the architectural discipline to get there. They optimized for quarterly earnings. [ ASML optimized for solving the one problem that would redefine the industry. ] ​ 

 That "stupid" idea Nikon dismissed? It built a €281 billion monopoly. ​ 

 ** Don't diversify to survive. Focus until the problem you solve can't be solved by anyone else. **

#  Companies Stopped Betting on You 

 Inside the power tax destroying loyalty 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 13th, 2025 ​ 

 AT&T's CEO just told 99,000 employees something few executives have admitted in public: 

 We have consciously shifted away from loyalty. 

 ** For half a century, corporations ran on a handshake deal: ** companies bet on people before they proved themselves, and people bet on companies before they proved themselves. ** ** 

 ​ [ John Stankey just announced that deal is over. ] ​ 

 His 2,500-word memo went viral because of what he admitted: ** companies now collect commitment without giving it back. ** "Some of you may have started your tour expecting an 'employment deal' rooted in loyalty," he wrote. "We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements." 

 Wall Street rewarded his honesty. AT&T stock is up 46% over the last 12 months. When companies have power, they can extract commitment without reciprocating. 

 ** The power tax is what happens when companies collect full loyalty without paying any of their own. ** 
##  The Power Tax in Action 

 Stankey's memo is a perfect case study in how this works. 

 AT&T demands five-day office presence for "predictable collaboration." Complete cultural alignment with "market-based" priorities. Measurable contribution tracked through behavioral analytics. Commitment without question or negotiation. 

 ** In return? A desk, a laptop, and the privilege of not being fired yet. ** 

 ​ [ This wasn't always possible. ] Companies used to bet on unproven people through training programs, development paths, and job security. 

 The promise of AI is giving companies alternatives to humans. Market concentration gave them leverage. Economic uncertainty gave them cover. ** When companies can dictate these terms, loyalty becomes irrational. ** 
##  The Mercenary Evidence 

 ​ [ Meta offers $100M signing bonuses because culture can't retain talent when commitment is one-sided ] . ServiceNow's CEO celebrates replacing humans with AI that [ "works 24/7, doesn't need lunch, and has no healthcare benefits." ] ​ 

 ​ [ Dell doubled their stock while employee satisfaction crashed ] . 93% of CEOs are implementing AI, [ more plan workforce cuts than expansions ] for the first time since 2020, and job seekers report needing 100-250 applications for a single interview. 

 Three predictable responses emerge: 

 ** Top performers sell to the highest bidder. ** When companies won't commit, why should talent? 

 ** Everyone else builds exit strategies. ** The power tax teaches people that work relationships are transactional. "You are just a distant memory after a few days," writes one former employee. If you need help from work friends, "you must ask IMMEDIATELY" because tomorrow they'll have moved on. 

 ** Surveillance replaces trust. ** Stankey brags about analyzing "behavioral patterns from broad cohorts" to identify "outliers." When you extract commitment rather than earn it, you have to monitor for disloyalty. 
##  Why It Backfires 

 ** But the power tax contains the seeds of its own destruction. ** 

 AI shrinks teams. That makes every remaining human exponentially more important. Exactly when the power tax teaches them not to care. 

 The human cost is stark: 20 months of service, 1.5 weeks severance. Three layoffs in five years becoming normal. Healthcare workers facing AI replacement despite being called "essential" just years ago. 

 ** The social fabric doesn't rebuild automatically. Once people learn that commitment is extracted, not reciprocated, they stay guarded. Trust, once broken systematically, becomes impossible to restore. ** 

 A harsh economic reality enables this split: 50% of consumer spending comes from the top 10% of earners. 

 Companies can serve concentrated markets with fewer workers; but only if those workers are fully engaged, not just compliant. 
##  What Happens Next 

 The power tax creates two paths for every organization: 

 ** Path 1: Perfect the extraction model. ** Use market leverage to demand everything while offering minimum viable employment. Optimize for short-term metrics while organizational capacity slowly erodes. 

 ** Path 2: Build reciprocal commitment. ** Use power to invest in people before they prove themselves, creating actual competitive advantage through genuine loyalty. 

 AT&T chose extraction. Stock up 46%, engagement down, organizational memory scarred. Stankey proved you can squeeze short-term performance when people can't afford to leave. 

 But power dynamics shift. When you need people to commit to uncertain outcomes, you can't train them that commitment is a one-way street. 

 LegacyCos are perfecting extraction. 
 The winners of the next decade will perfect reciprocity.

#  Frame Break 
#  Gartner's Dual Threats 

 When procurement freezes and AI replicates 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 12th, 2025 ​ 

 Gartner's stock has crashed 53% this year. 
 ​ 
 Their federal business has halved. 

 Yet Q2 revenue grew 5.7% to $1.7B, expanded EBITDA 6.6%. The disconnect reveals something deeper. ​ 

 The market saw something else: 
 ​ ** → Contract Value growth: ** 7.9% (Q4) → 6.7% (Q1) → 4.9% (Q2) 
 ​ ** → Federal business: ** ~47% dollar retention, down from a stable base 
 ​ ** → Decision-making: ** From functional leaders to CFOs and CEOs 
 ​ ** → Stock: ** –53% YTD ​ 

 CEO Eugene Hall blamed DOGE and policy uncertainty. 

 Hall sees it differently. His guidance still calls for full-year revenue of $6.455B and a return to double-digit growth. 

 ** The market sees dual threats converging: ** procurement freezes while AI replicates, fracturing relationship-based sales models beyond repair. 
###  ** Threat One: Procurement Freezes ** 

 47% dollar retention. When your 'safest' customers cut you in half, every other client is watching. ​ 

 Government buyers don't switch vendors, they renew automatically. This was Gartner's most predictable revenue stream. 

 Hall shared this has spread beyond government: "Purchase decisions...are now being escalated to the CFO or even the CEO." 

 DOGE gave every CFO permission to question advisory spending. The federal collapse is becoming the enterprise playbook. 

 ** The Escalation Death Spiral ** 

 This federal pattern is spreading fast. Gartner's $6.3B business was built on functional leaders making quick decisions based on trusted relationships. 

 When decisions escalate to CFOs who've never heard of the analysts, the sales engine freezes - cycles lengthen, deals stall, relationships die. 
###  ** Threat Two: AI Replication ** 

 As if procurement paralysis wasn't enough, AI emerged as the second threat. Anyone can already paste Gartner content into ChatGPT for instant summaries. AI generates research reports that feel equivalent to basic human analysis. 

 The paywall is structurally broken it just hasn't fully collapsed yet. 

 Management points to 500,000 executive conversations as proof of their human edge. But when CFOs control spend, those calls get harder to secure and easier to question when AI delivers something similar in seconds. 

 ** AskGartner: Augmentation or Admission? ** 

 Facing this reality, they launched AskGartner: instant AI answers from their research archive. 

 Hall calls it "augmentation, not replacement." But the market sees it differently. If clients can get instant Gartner insights through AI, why pay $25,000 for analyst access? 

 AskGartner trains clients to expect instant answers, not analyst phone calls. Each successful interaction erodes the justification for premium human access. They're building the very thing that could replace them. 

 ** Why Defense Is Impossible ** 

 This response exposes Gartner's deeper vulnerability. When your core metric collapses 50% in six months while your product becomes replicable, committee decisions become a luxury you can't afford. 

 Gartner operates with governance built for gradual change. Top analysts realize they can leave, use the same AI tools, and compete independently - turning institutional knowledge into portable expertise. 
###  ** The Escape Route ** 

 The only escape requires destroying what made them profitable. 

 ** Embedded workflows could work - becoming infrastructure, not content. ** But this demands dismantling the analyst pyramid while the current model still prints money. Gartner would need to accept fewer analysts, lower pricing, and deeper client integration. 

 The very changes that could save them require cannibalizing their high-margin business model. 

 ** The Reckoning ** 

 The debate isn't whether Gartner's human expertise matters - it's whether their business model can capture that value when procurement freezes and AI replicates. 

 DOGE proved that even "essential" knowledge work can be cut overnight. AI is proving that knowledge work can be replicated instantly. 

 ** Top analysts are learning they can compete independently. ** 

 For every knowledge business watching: your most stable revenue streams became your most vulnerable. The enterprise sales model that built billions is breaking in real time. 

 Gartner still has time, resources, and market position to lead this transformation. 

 The question is whether they'll cannibalize themselves before the market does it for them.

## Your Rails Determine Your Scale

#  Frame Break 
#  Your Rails Determine Your Scale 

 Every adjacency without shared rails builds a second company 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 11th, 2025 ​ 

 Expanding service offerings feels safe. 
 Unless you've earned it, it's fatal. 

 In 2022, a LegacyCo acquired an AI implementation boutique to "own AI transformation." Engineering pods, product managers, tempo-driven sprints; everything that made the boutique valuable. 

 Six months later, half the engineers had left. The capability got buried in committee structures. It was as if they had paid millions to destroy their own acquisition. 

 This is architectural inevitability. 
 And it starts with a lie everyone believes. 
###  ** The Zero-Sum Game Nobody Admits ** 

 NewCos win through velocity. 
 LegacyCos win through coverage. 
 ​ 
 ​ ** When NewCos chase coverage, they surrender the only advantage that matters. ** Every hour on adjacencies is an hour not accelerating your core. Every engineer building your second service isn't perfecting your first. Every sales call pitching breadth isn't deepening your wedge. 

 ​ [ Coherence tells you where to compete. ] ​ 
 ​ [ Clockspeed determines if you'll still exist when you get there. ] 
 Rails determine whether expansion multiplies your power or divides it. 

 It is key to master all three or become what you're disrupting. 
###  ** Why Early Metrics Lie ** 

 ** Year one looks brilliant. ** New service, new revenue, new slides for the board. Your friendly clients buy. The pipeline swells. Everyone celebrates the TAM expansion. 

 ** Year two reveals the debt. ** Launch-to-outcome time degrades. Sales motions conflict. Your story fragments. Different buyers need different proofs. Different services need different systems. 

 By ** year three, you're orchestrating complexity ** instead of compounding advantage. You've become what you meant to disrupt. 

 Unless you test for architecture first. 
###  ** The Architecture Test ** 

 ** Expansion is an architectural decision, not a commercial one. ** Most discover this after they've built two companies sharing one P&L. 

 Before adding any service, three questions determine survival: Does it reuse 70% of your core rails? Can you ship in 90 days with existing infrastructure? Will your current clients buy through your current GTM flow? 

 Define your rails before you need them. 

 ** For platforms: ** shared data models, APIs, workflows. 
 ​ ** For services: ** delivery, knowledge base, client relationships. 
 ​ ** For agencies: ** talent profiles, culture, incentive structures. 
 ​ 
 What you can't measure, you'll manipulate. 

 ** Even 100% technical reuse fails if the expansion needs different humans. ** That boutique AI firm didn't fail because of systems. It failed because engineering DNA can't survive committee cultures. 

 Culture is architecture too. 
###  ** The Compound Truth ** 

 Watch two companies over time. 

 ** Company A adds adjacencies that share rails. ** Telemetry from service one makes service two smarter. Components built once accelerate everything. Single buyer relationship deepens with each addition. Clockspeed increases. 

 ** Company B adds adjacencies that need new systems. ** Engineers split focus. Delivery models conflict. Different buyers fragment the narrative. Clockspeed decreases. 

 The gap compounds quarterly. Not because one works harder. Because ** one's architecture multiplies force while the other divides it. ** 

 The discipline isn't rigid adherence to rules. It's knowing when you're choosing strategic necessity versus telling yourself comfortable lies. 
###  ** The Choice ** 

 Most discover which path they chose when changing paths means starting over. 

 ** LegacyCos expand because they can. 
 NewCos expand because their rails demand it. ** 

 One builds empires that crumble from complexity. The other builds machines that compound through constraint. 

 Architecture is destiny. Most just discover it too late.

#  The Blindness We Choose 

 What amplifies in the dark while we optimize in the light 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 10th, 2025 ​ 

 Progress amplifies everything. 

 Including what we refuse to see. 

 We built the mobile phone to connect. 
 Instead, [ we lost presence ] . 

 Created one-click shopping for convenience. 
 ​ [ Got overconsumption ] . 

 Designed social platforms for community. 
 ​ [ Manufactured comparison ] . 

 ** None from malice. All from blindness. ** 

 The speed of change has collapsed the timeline between action and consequence. What once took decades now happens in months. 

 ** We are trying to govern exponential change with linear thinking. ** Technology's pace only widens the gap. 

 ​ [ Inside tech's echo chamber we celebrate abundance while outside, anxiety spreads about vanishing futures ] . 

 This isn't ignorance. We're conditioned not to see. Blindness is how modern progress works. ** The dangerous part isn't change itself, but our refusal to map consequences before they compound. ** 

 Who decides which consequences count? 

 ​ [ Without stillness to counter speed ] , we're not leading, simply accelerating. 

 Progress without foresight isn't wisdom. 
 It's just velocity. 

 ** Reflection for the week: ** What will history say we saw coming but refused to prevent?

#  Life through Keyholes 

 Why we perfect cages we never built 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 17th, 2025 ​ 

 We optimize inside frames we never chose. 

 Then wonder why we can't break free. 

 ** The successful are the most trapped. ** 

 Their frame worked once - so when the image blurs, they scrub the lens harder. Because widening the frame means abandoning the very identity that brought success. 

 This is how we're all trained. 

 We master slivers: what to study, where to work, which tiny piece to own. Life through keyholes, not horizons. So when the image blurs we resort to fixing it in the only way we know. 

 ** To say "you don't need a frame" is heresy. ** You're asking people to discard society's assumptions and their own. 

 The few who transcend seem alien. We call it privilege. But it's not the ability that's rare - it's willingness. 

 ** The frame isn't yours. ** 

 It was handed to you by parents, teachers, bosses, systems. 

 That's why letting go feels like dying. 

 The prison was never locked. We've just come to love the cage. 

 ** Reflection for the week: ** Who would you be without their frame?

#  The Death of Attention 

 How "one more thing" became our operating system 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 9th, 2025 ​ 

 Yesterday I caught myself saying it again. 

 "Let me start one more thing." 

 Three half-finished posts stared back at me. A portfolio company asking for feedback. An article I'd been meaning to read. 

 I've built systems for everything - deal flow, knowledge management, task tracking, note-taking. Each promising to solve the chaos. Each adding another layer to navigate. 

 ** I've optimized every process and lost sight of the system. ** 

 Because I love the dance of progress. Pretending that improvement is just one system away. Because that delays the death of what must actually die: ** The illusion that you can have it all. ** 

 I fill my life with distractions so I [ never have to face stillness ] . That's the real problem - not the tools, but what they're protecting us from. 

 Every new system is another layer separating us from the truth: [ ** We don't know what to choose, so we choose everything. ** ] ​ 

 When I work on my NewCo thesis, the work that matters most today my attention narrows naturally. I find flow. Then I step away. Not because I’m done, but because something in me seeks the next hit: a distraction, a project, a new ‘opportunity.’ 

 Why? 

 Because choosing one thing means killing all the others. And we'd rather suffer from abundance than commit to focus. 

 ** We say we want better attention. We don't. We want control. ** 

 Perfect schedules. Productivity stacks. Morning rituals. Evening reviews. [ We're trying to engineer our humanity away ] , converting ourselves into machines that can process everything. 

 ** But attention isn't a throughput problem. It's a courage problem. ** 

 → The courage to say: This matters. That doesn't. 

 → The courage to disappoint people who expect immediate responses. 

 → The courage to kill projects that could work but shouldn't. 

 → The courage to face the silence when the notifications stop. 

 We're running survival software in an abundance world. No wonder we're exhausted. 

 The solution isn't another tool. It's accepting a harder truth: 

 ** In a world where you can do anything, choosing to do everything is choosing to do nothing well. ** 

 The tools multiply. The tabs stay open. The notifications never stop. 

 Because closing them means choosing. And choosing means facing what we're avoiding: 

 ** The terrifying possibility that we already know what matters. We just lack the courage to admit it. ** 

 One more thing won't save us. 
 One less thing might.

#  Leverage Crisis 

 Start from pain, not possibility 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 8th, 2025 ​ 

 Every tool promises 10x productivity. 

 Every person feels 10x more anxious. 

 My product designer friend can prototype in hours what took weeks. She has every AI tool imaginable. Yet she's drowning. "I waste entire days evaluating tools instead of building," she told me. "The possibilities are paralyzing." 

 Her paralysis highlighted something critical: 

 ** The smartest people in my network aren't trying every new tool. ** They're eliminating soul-crushing work by asking: What part of my day makes me want to scream? Then they point AI at that problem. 

 Before: Research meant finding dozens of links, filtering good from bad, reading hundreds of forum topics. Hours of grinding. Now: ** ** Deep Research handles that in minutes. 

 Before: Product design meant specs → designers → developers → prototype → feedback. Months of coordination. Now: Prototype first. Get user feedback in days. 

 This efficiency gain exposes the real crisis: ** abundance creates anxiety. ** 

 A product designer can now code, write, analyze data, create videos. The boundaries dissolved overnight, but our brains still crave yesterday's constraints. "I can do anything" became "I don't know where to start." 

 ** The real enemy? Scarcity-era managers running abundance-era companies. ** 

 They see 10x tools and demand 10x output. They optimize for utilization, not clarity. For tool adoption, not human capacity. 

 The result? Their best people face a toxic combination: 

 ** First, the paralysis of infinite choice: "What should I do?" ** 

 ** Then, the pressure of infinite expectation: "Why haven't you 10x'd yet?" ** 

 The tools multiply. The people burn out. 

 ** The best companies see what's happening: ** 

 Winners protect focus like a scarce resource. They measure workflows eliminated, not tools deployed. They understand infinite leverage requires finite focus. 

 One transformed process beats ten new subscriptions. 

 Winners eliminate what hurts before adding what helps. They free cognitive capacity first, then reinvest it in strategic decisions. This is where leverage compounds. 

 When everyone has the same tools, only human judgment differentiates. 

 ** The paths diverge here: ** 

 Keep adding tools. Increase pressure. Watch your best people burn out under infinite possibility and expectation. 

 Or start from pain. Protect focus. Build the only real moat - humans who can transform infinite leverage into strategic advantage. 

 ** AI didn't cause the burnout. Scarcity thinking did. ** 

 We're burning out our best people right when we need them most. 

 The window won't stay open long and neither will they.

#  Case Study #16: Algorithmic Orchestration 

 What NewCo can learn from Shein's 3-day fashion revolution 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 7th, 2025 ​ 

 Zara pioneered fast fashion. Shein deleted the middlemen. 

 Guangzhou, 2015. 

 ** Chris Xu saw the bottleneck: Chinese factories could make anything but had no idea what Western teens wanted. ** 

 The solution wasn't faster factories. It was removing the humans between signal and production. 

 By 2016, Xu connected 5,000 suppliers into a coordination loop powered by [ algorithms tracking TikTok trends ] . Those signals triggered micro-batch test orders directly. 

 ** No merchandisers, no buyers, no creative directors. ** 

 Zara moved in 2 to 3 weeks. Shein shipped in 3 to 7 days. Everyone credits Shein's price. [ The real disruption was clockspeed ] , generating 20x more SKUs than Zara or H&M. 

 While competitors digitized human workflows, Shein deleted them. They didn't automate merchandising. They architected a system that didn't need merchandisers. 
###  ** The Moat Isn't Tech. It's Negative Space ** 

 Shein's competitive advantage isn't what they built. It's what they removed: No seasonal collections No designer ego No SKU minimums No fixed inventory bets No global retail footprint 

 ** Plus one critical addition: Shein pays suppliers weekly, not the industry-standard 90 days. ** 

 This isn't generosity. It's architecture. Fast payment funds fast production and locks in 6,000 exclusive factories. 

 Competitors can't copy this without tearing out their own operating assumptions. Switching costs aren't technical. They're existential. 
###  ** Why Now? The Algorithmic Shift ** 

 This model isn't simply clever. It's inevitable. We're watching what happens when AI and manufacturing converge: digital systems coordinate physical production in real-time. 

 ** The old playbook required human interpretation at every step. ** That assumption is slowly becoming irrelevant. When algorithms can read demand signals and trigger production directly, companies don't optimize workflows. They delete them. 
###  ** Here's How That Deletion Works ** 

 Traditional fast fashion is a relay race: Trendspotters → Designers → Merchandisers → Buyers → Factories Each handoff adds days. Each loses signal. 

 ​ [ Shein's LATR (Large-scale Automated Test & Reorder) model ] creates a closed loop instead: Algorithm detects social signals Micro-batch produced (10 to 100 units) Sell-through data determines reorder Top SKUs scale, flops vanish 

 The physical architecture mirrors the digital: 5,000 suppliers within 5 kilometers in Guangzhou's Panyu district, all linked by [ Shein's proprietary Manufacturing Execution System. ] Physical proximity enables digital velocity. ​ 

 No committees. No gatekeepers. No "merchandising vision." Just a learning loop compressing decision latency to zero. 

 ​ [ Shein's 2024 revenue was $38B. ] Zara came in at $6B. 
###  ** The Universal Pattern ** 

 This isn't about fashion. ** Every industry has coordination taxes waiting to be deleted: ** Law firms bill endless hours reviewing contracts where algorithms can flag anomalies in seconds Insurance pre-authorizations drag for weeks on decisions algorithms could make instantly Enterprise software deployments take months for configurations that should be automatic 

 The constraint is no longer talent or capital. It's coordination latency. 
###  ** Coordination vs. Judgment ** 

 This isn't about removing humans. ** It's about removing humans from the wrong parts of the system. ** 

 Coordination is friction. Judgment is leverage. 

 Shein still needs humans to design the system, manage exceptions, build trust. But they made one bold call: Keep humans where they add value. Eliminate them where they don't. 
###  ** Final Principle: Don't Optimize the Tax. Remove It. ** 

 Your competitors are still optimizing the tax. ** You should be designing around its absence. ** 

 The winners of this era won't be those who automate everything. 

 They'll be the ones who know what not to automate and structure around it.

#  Living in Two Timelines 

 The gap is accelerating 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 6th, 2025 ​ 

 I open LinkedIn. Two realities stare back. 

 One timeline is printing money. The other is frozen. 

 This week, the split became undeniable. 

 ** Palantir: ** $1B quarterly revenue. 10x growth plan. Reducing headcount. ​ 

 ** US Jobs report: ** -258,000. Largest revision outside a crisis. 

 Same economy? 

 ** Timeline One: Tech growing exponentially. ** 

 ** Timeline Two: Everything else frozen. ** 

 The dissonance is dizzying. 
###  ** Timeline One: The Acceleration ** 

 Open any tech news site. The headlines are breathtaking: 

 → [ ** Palantir hits $1B quarterly revenue ** ] , up 48%. CEO Karp: " [ We're planning to grow revenue 10x while decreasing our number of people from 4,100 to 3,600. ] " 

 → [ Figma IPOs 250% first-day pop ] - the biggest ever for a $1B+ offering. ** Trading at 55x forward revenue. Market cap: $67B. ** 

 → [ NVIDIA reports $44B quarterly revenue ] , up 69%. Data center revenue alone: $39B, up 73%. ** Market cap: $4.35T ** 

 → [ Meta crushes Q2: $47.5B revenue ] , 43% operating margins. Headcount up only 7% while ** revenue jumps 22%. ** 

 → [ OpenAI doubles to $12B ARR ] in just 7 months. 700 million weekly active users. ** Raising money at a $500B valuation. ** 

 → [ Harvey AI hits $100M ARR ] with ** only 500 customers ** . That's $200k per customer. 

 → [ Lovable reaches $100M ARR ] in 8 months - ** fastest growing startup globally. ** 

 If this is your world - you are living through a golden age. 
###  ** Timeline Two: The Stagnation ** 

 Switch tabs. Different movie entirely: 

 → [ US jobs report revises down 258,000 positions ] - ** largest revision outside a recession. ** Temporary help services down 9 consecutive months, historically a recession signal. 

 → [ ** Graduate hiring compressing ** ] ** : ** McKinsey, Goldman, JPMorgan slash entry-level programs by 40-60%. Traditional career pipelines vanishing. ​ 

 → [ ** Retail apocalypse: ** ] Store closures hit 7,000 in H1 2025. Foot traffic down 23% YoY. "Recession-Proof" dollar stores shuttering locations. 

 → [ Credit card delinquencies hit decade highs. ] ** Total debt exceeds $1.1 trillion. ** [ Subprime auto defaults now worse than 2008. ] ​ 

 → [ Chapter 11 bankruptcies up 13.1% year-over-year. ] Companies that survived on cheap debt ** can't service loans at current rates. ** 

 → [ Office vacancy rates exceed 30% in major cities. ] ** $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate loans ** need refinancing at elevated rates. 

 → ** Full-time jobs disappearing: ** [ Economy lost 744,308 full-time positions while adding part-time jobs. ] Quality employment evaporating. 

 → [ Small business optimism below 50-year average for two straight years. ] ** Top problems: inflation and can't find the right talent. ** 

 Live here alone? Foundations crumbling. 

 Two economies. Two physics. One market trying to price both. 
###  ** The Reality ** 

 ​ [ This is The Switch ] - when companies stop pretending people matter and start optimizing them away. 

 ** Timeline One: Fewer People × Tech Leverage = Exponential Value ** 

 ** Timeline Two: More People + Same Playbook = Declining Returns ** 

 Wells Fargo's CEO called attrition "our friend." 20 quarters of cuts. [ Revenue per employee is the new EPS. ] ​ 

 ** The top 10 S&P companies disconnected from the other 490 because they get it. ** Palantir trades at over 100x revenue. Accenture? TCS? Capgemini? The market is doubting their billions in revenue. ​ 

 Both timelines are real. 

 The comfortable middle is compressing. Average companies struggling to muddle through. Average workers can't build careers. 

 ** You're either exponential or expendable. ** 

 The gap is accelerating. 

 Standing with one foot in each timeline feels like paralysis. 

 But maybe that's exactly where you need to be. 

 Most value will be created in the space between timelines. That's not a comfortable position. But comfort was never really an option. 

 ** The interesting question isn't which timeline wins. It's how you compound small advantages while others wait for clarity. **

 Stable margins. Stagnant growth. A falling stock price. 

 This isn't a cyclical downturn. It's an architectural crisis. 

 Capgemini's problem isn't the weak European macro-environment it blames for its woes. Its problem is that the company's own operating system is a perfect replica of that environment: ** consensus-driven, risk-averse, and built for a level of stability that is now a liability. ** 

 This quarter's numbers reveal a company at a standstill: ** Revenue growth: ** +0.2% in H1 2025 ** Operating Margins: ** 12.4% for H1 2025 ** France operations: ** -5.0% decline ** AI bookings: ** 7% of Q2 ** Stock price: ** -21.6% YTD 

 The DNA that built a European champion now prevents it from matching the [ required clockspeed to avoid disruption ] . ​ 
###  ** The European Operating System ** 

 Accenture is American. TCS is Indian. Capgemini is European. This isn't a geographic observation; it's an architectural one. 

 As a [ Societas Europaea ] operating under French labor laws, Capgemini must include employees on its board and consult unions before making major decisions. The company operates within what investors call a [ "timid and risk-averse business culture" strangled by "suffocating regulations." ] ​ 

 The result? ** A company perfected for sovereign cloud, defense, and long-cycle compliance projects where trust trumps speed. ** Their core competency is navigating a low-clockspeed world. The problem is that its speed increasingly lags that of the market. 

 This low-clockspeed architecture creates an impossible internal conflict. 
###  ** The Cannibal's Dilemma ** 

 The CEO admitted it on the [ H1 2025 earnings call: clients "expect some savings in productivity" from GenAI, with margins taking "18 to 24 months to recover" on large consolidation deals. ] ​ 

 Translation: ** 'Productivity savings' means fewer billable hours. ** That 18-24 month recovery period? It's Capgemini bleeding revenue while praying AI creates enough new work to compensate. 

 While Capgemini negotiates with unions, [ Accenture consolidates five divisions ] and [ TCS cuts 12,000 employees ] . Speed is the new currency and Capgemini has everything tied up in long term investments. 

 ** Trapped by its own architecture, Capgemini defaults to its only move: acquisition. ** 
###  ** The WNS Gambit: Buying Speed, Not Building It ** 

 ​ [ The $3.3 billion WNS acquisition reveals the strategic bind. ] WNS built exactly what Capgemini couldn't: outcome-based contracts (24% of revenue), verticalized AI platforms delivering 40-60% productivity gains, operating at a higher-clockspeed. 

 ** The strategy is pure Capgemini: acquire what you can't build. ** It's how they've always transformed - from CAP in 1973 to Ernst & Young Consulting, iGate, Altran, and now WNS. $20 billion spent buying change rather than creating it. 

 ** But instead of adopting WNS's model, Capgemini bets it can methodically integrate these capabilities into its existing structure. ** 

 They're using yesterday's playbook for tomorrow's problem - doubling down on their architectural identity rather than escaping it. 

 ** Operational resilience no longer commands a premium ** . The market is now pricing for velocity. 

 The challenge is not how to navigate the next two quarters. It is to answer a single, existential question: ** Can a company built for the predictable, consensus-driven world of the 20th century fundamentally rewire its DNA to compete in the high-clockspeed, winner-take-all world of the 21st? ** 

 The ultimate risk isn't that Capgemini will fail. 

 It's that it will succeed at being what it has always been: a deeply competent, stable, and resilient company that is perfectly engineered for a world that is swiftly fading away. 

 Aiman Ezzat does not have a growth mandate. 

 He has an architectural mandate.

## Clockspeed Determines Who Survives

#  Clockspeed Determines Who Survives 

 Every approval layer adds another crack 

 Usman Sheikh 

 August 4th, 2025 ​ 

 Coherence without clockspeed is perfect strategy. 
 Clockspeed without coherence is wasted motion. 

 In computing, clockspeed measures operations per second. In organizations, it measures ** how quickly the entire system senses, decides, and acts as one. ** 

 Most firms confuse activity with velocity: agile teams, daily standups, rapid prototypes. 

 But when those teams wait weeks for staffing approvals, months for knowledge retrieval, quarters for risk committee clearance, the organization's true clockspeed reveals itself. 

 ** Every firm operates at the frequency of its slowest critical path. ** 

 Years of accumulated process debt create organizational inertia. The constraint isn't where you think it is. 

 Your clockspeed reveals itself in one critical moment: ** How long between identifying what a client needs and deploying the right expertise to deliver it? ** 

 In professional services, this latency kills value. The bottleneck isn't budget or technology. It's the time to match expertise to opportunity. 

 Leading firms measure this gap in days. 

 Lagging firms don't measure it at all. 

 ** The gap between leaders and laggards isn't luck. It's architecture. ** 

 Here's how a high clockspeed firm (HCF) builds it: 
###  ** Continuous Learning Loops ** 

 Most firms learn in episodes: quarterly reviews, annual planning, post-mortems. Knowledge freezes between these moments. 

 HCF's instrument every client interaction. [ Loop captures which invoice exceptions occur, which rules fire, how long each step takes. ] Every transaction makes the system smarter. Every deployment teaches the next. 
###  ** Knowledge as Living Infrastructure ** 

 Traditional firms document processes in PowerPoints that expire on creation. Best practices gather dust in portals. 

 HCF's encode knowledge as executable logic. [ Palantir's FDEs build data models that capture how decisions actually flow through Fortune 500s. ] When Singapore discovers a pattern, São Paulo uses it immediately. The knowledge lives in the system, not someone's head. 
###  ** Synchronous Decision Rights ** 

 Traditional structures separate expertise from authority. Practitioners have knowledge, partners have power. Every insight climbs layers for approval. 

 Fast organizations embed authority where expertise lives. [ Haier's 4,000 micro-enterprises operate with full P&L control. ] When they spot opportunity, they move. The market decides, not managers. 

 Each component accelerates the others. Learning enriches infrastructure. Infrastructure enables decisions. Decisions generate learning. The flywheel spins faster with every turn. 

 ** Speed compounds. So does friction. ** 

 This internal acceleration matters because the external world won't wait. Markets now move in days. Clients decide in hours. Talent chooses in minutes. 

 Yet most professional services firms still operate in quarters. 

 ** This gap won't close with better processes or flatter org charts. ** It requires rebuilding your operating system around a fundamental truth: in a world where expertise is abundant but attention is scarce, ** clockspeed isn't an advantage. ** 

 ** It's the last remaining competitive moat. ** 

 ​ [ High coherence ] tells you where to compete. High clockspeed determines whether you'll still be competing when you get there. 

 The question isn't whether to increase your clockspeed. It's whether you'll architect for it intentionally or discover your ceiling painfully.
