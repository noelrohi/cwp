# Tasks from Usman's Call

## Snips Feature

### High Priority
- [x] Fix snip card display - something wrong at the card when back text value is too long that makes it unreadable
- [x] Add snip button to saved signals (and potentially pending signals)
- [x] When creating a snip, automatically save the signal as well (single action does both) - possible only in the pending tab - for saved we keep it that way
- [x] Hyperlink snips to the saved filtered view of the episode/source
- [x] Add expand/collapse functionality for snip cards to show full content
- [x] Add tagging functionality to snips (for ontology building)
- [x] Show saved indicator on episode signals when they have snips
- [x] Add saved filter to signals page

### Future Features
- [ ] Daily review feature (similar to Readwise daily review)
- [ ] Email digest of snips
- [ ] Question generation from snips for chat integration

## Signal Display

### Sorting & Filtering
- [x] **Always order signals highest to lowest score by default on every page**
- [ ] Ensure high quality filter works correctly
- [x] Add saved filter to signals view

### UI Improvements
- [ ] Fix article images being absorbed/displayed incorrectly
- [ ] Show processing status more clearly on dashboard
- [ ] Make saved filter easily accessible from episode view

## Dashboard
- [ ] Reduce overwhelm - dashboard should be more passive
- [ ] Clear indication of what's been processed vs pending
- [ ] Better visual hierarchy for new content

## Confidence Curve
- [ ] Complete confidence curve implementation based on snips (currently in progress)

## Notes
- Articles with RSS feed processing and signal generation is complete
- Snips are the primary focus for second brain functionality
- Tags will help build ontology across all snips
- Questions from snips will integrate with chat feature
